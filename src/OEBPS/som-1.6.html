<h2>1.6 Agents and Agencies</h2>

    <p>
      We want to explain intelligence as a combination of simpler things.
      This means that we must be sure to check, at every step, that none of
      our agents is, itself, intelligent. Otherwise, our theory would end up
      resembling the nineteenth-century <em>chessplaying machine</em> that was
      exposed by Edgar Allan Poe to actually conceal a human dwarf inside.
      Accordingly, whenever we find that an agent has to do anything
      complicated, we&#39;ll replace it with a subsociety of agents that do
      simpler things. Because of this, the reader must be prepared to feel a
      certain sense of loss. When we break things down to their smallest
      parts, they&#39;ll each seem dry as dust at first, as though some
      essence has been lost.</p>

    <p>
      For example, we&#39;ve seen how to construct a tower-building skill by
      making Builder from little parts like Find and Get. Now, where does
      its <em>knowing-how-to-build</em> reside when, clearly, it is not in any
      part &mdash; and yet those parts are all that Builder is? The answer: It
      is not enough to explain only what each separate agent does. We must
      also understand how those parts are interrelated &mdash; that is, how
      groups of agents can accomplish things.</p>

    <p>
      Accordingly, each step in this book uses two different ways to think
      about agents. If you were to watch Builder work, from the outside, with
      no idea of how it works inside, you&#39;d have the impression that it
      knows how to build towers. But if you could see Builder from the inside,
      you&#39;d surely find no knowledge there. You would see nothing more
      than a few switches, arranged in various ways to turn each other on and
      off. Does Builder <em>really know</em> how to build towers? The answer
      depends on how you look at it. Let&#39;s use two different words,
      <em>agent</em> and <em>agency,</em> to say why Builder seems to lead a
      double life.  As agency, it seems to know its job. As agent, it cannot
      know anything at all.</p>

    <p>
      When you drive a car, you regard the steering wheel as an agency that
      you can use to change the car&#39;s direction. You don&#39;t care how it
      works. But when something goes wrong with the steering, and you want to
      understand what&#39;s happening, it&#39;s better to regard the steering
      wheel as just one agent in a larger agency: it turns a shaft that turns
      a gear to pull a rod that shifts the axle of a wheel. Of course, one
      doesn&#39;t always want to take this microscopic view; if you kept all
      those details in mind while driving, you might crash because it took too
      long to figure out which way to turn the wheel. Knowing how is not the
      same as knowing why. In this book, we&#39;ll always be switching between
      agents and agencies because, depending on our purposes, we&#39;ll have
      to use different viewpoints and kinds of descriptions.</p>
