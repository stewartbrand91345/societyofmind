<h2>20.6 the nemeic spiral</h2>

    <p>
      Our polynemes and micronemes grow into great branching networks that
      reach every level of every agency. They approximate the general form
      of a hierarchy, but one that is riddled with shortcuts, cross-
      connections, and exceptions. No one could ever comprehend all the
      details of the connections that develop inside a single human
      individual; that would amount to grasping how all that person&#39;s
      thoughts and inclinations interact. At best, we can envision only
      the broadest outlines of such structures:</p>

    <p>
      In regions near the agencies for speech, some elements of this
      network might signify or represent ideas and thoughts we can easily
      express in words. But because speaking is a social act, we are far
      less able to express the significance of the nemes involved with
      agencies that are not directly concerned with communication. This is
      because those agencies are less constrained by the discipline of
      public language; accordingly, the nemes inside those agencies can
      vary more from one person to the next.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, our higher-level agencies are generally unaware of what
      our lower-level agents do; they supervise and regulate &mdash; but
      scarcely comprehend at all &mdash; what happens among their
      subordinates. For example, a high-level agency might find that a
      certain subagency is unproductive, because it is responding to too
      many micronemes &mdash; or to too few &mdash; and adjust its
      sensitivity accordingly. Like a B-brain, a controlling agency could
      make such judgments without comprehending the local meanings of
      those micronemes. This could also provide a basis for controlling
      the levels of the activities of those other agencies &mdash; just as
      we suggested when we discussed the idea of a
      <em>spiral</em> computation within an agency and its K-line
      trees. When the work appears to be going well, the supervisor can
      direct the lower-level processes to <em>spiral down</em> toward
      small details. But when there seem to be too many obstacles, the
      level of activity would be made to <em>spiral up</em> instead, to
      levels capable of diagnosing and altering an ineffective plan.</p>
