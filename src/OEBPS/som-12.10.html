<h2>12.10 how towers work</h2>

    <p>
      Why can one build a tower or arch of stone or brick, but not of
      water, air, or sand? To answer that amounts to asking, <em>How do
	towers work?</em> But asking that seems quite perverse, because the
      answer seems so obvious: <em>Each block holds the next one up, and
	that&#39;s all there is to it!</em> As we&#39;ve said before:</p>

    <p>
      An idea will seem self-evident &mdash; once you&#39;ve forgotten
      learning it!</p>

    <p>
      We often use words like <em>insight</em> or <em>intuition</em> to
      talk about understandings that seem especially immediate. But it is
      bad psychology to assume that what seems <em>obvious</em> is
      therefore simple or self-evident. Many such things are done for us
      by huge, silent systems in our mind, built over long forgotten years
      of childhood. We rarely think about the giant engines we&#39;ve
      developed for understanding space, which work so quietly that they
      leave no traces in our consciousness. How towers work is something
      everyone has known for so long that it seems odd to mention it:</p>

    <p>
      A tower&#39;s height depends only upon the heights of its parts!
      None of the other properties of the blocks matter &mdash; neither
      what they cost, nor where they&#39;ve been, nor what you think of
      them.  Only lifting counts &mdash; so we can build a tower by
      thinking only about actions that increase its height.</p>

    <p>
      This makes tower building easy, by letting us separate the basic
      building plan from all the small details. To build a tower of a
      certain height, just find enough <em>pieces of height</em> and stack
      them up by lifting actions. But towers have to stay up, too. So the
      next problem is to find actions we can take to make our tower
      stable. Here we can use a second, wonderful principle:</p>

    <p>
      A tower is stable if each block is properly centered on the last.
      Because of this, we can build a tower by first lifting each block
      vertically and then adjusting it horizontally.</p>

    <p>
      Notice that this second kind of action &mdash; adjusting for
      stability &mdash; requires only horizontal movements, which do not
      affect the tower&#39;s height at all. This explains why towers are
      so easy to build.  To increase a tower&#39;s height, you need only
      vertical lifting actions.  The second-rank goal, stability, requires
      only horizontal sliding motions, which don&#39;t interact with
      height at all &mdash; provided the blocks have horizontal
      surfaces. This lets us achieve our tower-building goal simply by
      doing <em>first things first.</em></p>

    <p>
      To adults it is no mystery that height and width are independent of
      each other. But this is not so evident in infancy: to understand the
      world of space and time, each child must make many such discoveries.
      Still, the division into Lifting and Sliding has a special
      importance; there are an infinity of ways to move around inside the
      world: how could a person ever learn them all? The answer: We
      don&#39;t need to learn them all, because we can learn to deal with
      each dimension separately. Lifting has a special significance
      because it isolates the vertical dimension from the others and
      relates it to ideas about balancing. The complementary operations of
      Sliding can then be divided into two remaining dimensions: either to
      push and pull or to move from side to side. One way to Lift and two
      ways to Slide makes three &mdash; and that is just enough to move
      around in a three- dimensional world!</p>
