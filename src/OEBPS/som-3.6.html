<h2>3.6 Pain and pleasure simplified</h2>

    <p>
      When you&#39;re in pain, it&#39;s hard to keep your interest in other
      things.  You feel that nothing&#39;s more important than finding some
      way to stop the pain. That&#39;s why pain is so powerful: it makes it
      hard to think of anything else. Pain simplifies your point of view.</p>

    <p>
      When something gives you pleasure, then, too, it&#39;s hard to think of
      other things. You feel that nothing&#39;s more important than finding a
      way to make that pleasure last. That&#39;s why pleasure is so
      powerful. It also simplifies your point of view.</p>

    <p>
      Pain&#39;s power to distract us from our other goals is not an accident;
      that&#39;s how it helps us to survive. Our bodies are endowed with
      special nerves that detect impending injuries, and the signals from
      these nerves for pain make us react in special ways. Somehow, they
      disrupt our concerns with long-term goals &mdash; thus forcing us to
      focus on immediate problems, perhaps by transferring control to our
      lowest-level agencies. Of course, this can do more harm than good,
      especially when, in order to remove the source of pain, one has to make
      a complex plan. Unfortunately, pain interferes with making plans by
      undermining interest in anything that&#39;s not immediate. Too much
      suffering diminishes us by restricting the complexities that constitute
      our very selves. It must be the same for pleasure as well.</p>

    <p>
      We think of pleasure and pain as opposites, since pleasure makes us draw
      its object near while pain impels us to reject its object. We also think
      of them as similar, since both make rival goals seem small by turning us
      from other interests. They both distract. Why do we find such
      similarities between antagonistic things? Sometimes two seeming
      opposites are merely two extremes along a single scale, or one of them
      is nothing but the absence of the other &mdash; as in the case of sound
      and silence, light and darkness, interest and unconcern. But what of
      opposites that are genuinely different, like pain and pleasure, fear and
      courage, hate and love?</p>

    <p>
      In order to appear opposed, two things must serve related goals &mdash;
      or otherwise engage the selfsame agencies.</p>

    <p>
      Thus, affection and abhorrence both involve our attitudes toward
      relationships; and pleasure and pain both engage constraints that
      simplify our mental scenes. The same goes for courage and cowardice:
      each does best by knowing both. When on attack, you have to press
      against whatever weakness you can find in your opponent&#39;s strategy.
      When on defense, it&#39;s much the same: you still must guess the
      other&#39;s plan.</p>
