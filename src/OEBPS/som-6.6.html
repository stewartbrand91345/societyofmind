<h2>6.6 momentary mental time</h2>

      

    <p>
      What do you think you&#39;re thinking now? You might reply, <em>Why,
	just the thoughts I&#39;m thinking now!</em> And that makes sense, in
      ordinary life, where <em>now</em> means <em>at this moment in
	time.</em> But the meaning of
      <em>now</em> is far less clear for an agent inside a society.</p>

    <p>
      It takes some time for changes in one part of a mind to affect the other
      parts. There&#39;s always some delay.</p>

    <p>
      For example, suppose you meet your friend Jack. Your agencies for Voices
      and Faces may recognize Jack&#39;s voice and face, and both send
      messages to an agency Names, which may recall Jack&#39;s name. But
      Voices may also send a <em>word-message</em> to Quotes, a language-based
      agency that has a way to remember phrases Jack has said before, while
      Faces may also send a message to Places, an agency concerned with space,
      which might recall some earlier place in which Jack&#39;s face was seen.</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch6/6-2.png"/>
    <p>
      Now suppose we could ask both Places and Quotes which had happened
      first, seeing Jack or hearing his voice? We&#39;d get two different
      answers! Places will first detect the face &mdash; while Quotes will
      first detect the voice. The seeming order of events depends upon which
      message reached each agent first &mdash; so the seeming sequence of
      events differs from one agent to another. Each agent will react in its
      own, slightly different way &mdash; because it has been affected by a
      slightly different <em>causal history,</em> which spreads like a wave
      into the past.</p>

    <p>
      It is simply impossible, in general, for any agent P to know for certain
      what another agent Q is doing at precisely the same time. The best that
      P can do is send a query straight to Q and hope that Q can get a
      truthful message back before other agents change Q&#39;s state &mdash;
      or change its message along the way. No portion of a mind can ever know
      everything that is happening at the same time in all the other
      agencies. Because of this, each agency must have at least a slightly
      different sense both of what has happened in the past &mdash; and of
      what is happening <em>now.</em> Each different agent of the mind lives
      in a slightly different world of time.</p>
