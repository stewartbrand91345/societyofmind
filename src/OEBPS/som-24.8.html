<h2>24.8 how picture-frames work</h2>

    <p>
      Now that we&#39;ve seen how <em>picture-frames</em> could represent
      memories of spatial arrangements, let&#39;s ask how we actually
      build such frames. We&#39;ll use the same technique that we used to
      build Trans-frames, except for one small change. To make a
      picture-frame, we&#39;ll simply replace the pronomes of our
      Trans-frame scheme by a set of nine direction-nemes! The diagram
      below also includes an agent to serve for turning on the frame
      itself.</p>

    <p>
      To apply the picture-frames idea to how our vision-systems work,
      imagine that you&#39;re looking at some real-world scene. Your eyes
      move in various directions, controlled in some way by
      direction-nemes. Now suppose that every time you move your eyes, the
      same direction-nemes also activate the K-lines attached to the
      corresponding terminals of a certain vision-frame. Suppose, also,
      that those K-lines are ready to form new memories. Then each time
      you look in a different direction, your vision-system will describe
      what you see &mdash; and the corresponding K-line will record what
      you see when you look in that direction!</p>

    <p>
      Now suppose that the same frame is activated at some later date
      &mdash; but this time by means of memory and not from looking at
      some scene. Then, as any of your agencies conceives of looking in a
      certain direction, the thought itself will involve the activation of
      the corresponding direction-neme; then, before you have a chance to
      think of anything else, the corresponding K-line will be
      aroused. This creates a most remarkable effect:</p>

    <p>
      Whichever way your <em>mind&#39;s eye</em> looks, you&#39;ll seem to
      see the corresponding aspect of the scene. You will experience an
      almost perfect <em>simulus</em> of being there!</p>

    <p>
      How <em>real</em> could such a recollection seem? In principle, it
      could even seem as real as vision itself &mdash; since it could make
      you seem to sense not only how an object looks, but also how it
      tastes and feels. Shortly we&#39;ll see how this could yield not
      merely the sense of seeing a scene, but also the sense of being able
      to move around inside it.</p>
