<h1>2 Wholes And Parts</h1>
<h2>2.1 Components and connections</h2>

    <p>
      We saw that Builder&#39;s skill could be reduced to the simpler skills
      of Get and Put. Then we saw how these, in turn, could be made of even
      simpler ones. Get merely needs to Move the hand to Grasp the block that
      Find just found. Put only has to Move the hand so that it puts that
      block upon the tower top. So it might appear that all of Builder&#39;s
      functions have been <em>reduced</em> to things that simpler parts can
      do.</p>

    <p>
      But something important has been left out. Builder is not merely a
      collection of parts like Find, Get, Put, and all the rest. For Builder
      would not work at all unless those agents were linked to one another by
      a suitable network of interconnections.</p>

    <p>
      Could you predict what Builder does from knowing just that left-hand
      list? Of course not: you must also know which agents work for which.
      Similarly, you couldn&#39;t predict what would happen in a human
      community from knowing only what each separate individual can do; you
      must also know how they are organized &mdash; that is, who talks to
      whom. And it&#39;s the same for understanding any large and complex
      thing. First, we must know how each separate part works. Second, we must
      know how each part interacts with those to which it is connected. And
      third we have to understand how all these local interactions combine to
      accomplish what that system does &mdash; as seen from the outside.</p>

    <p>
      In the case of the human brain, it will take a long time to solve these
      three kinds of problems. First we will have to understand how brain
      cells work. This will be difficult because there are hundreds of
      different types of brain cells. Then we&#39;ll have to understand how
      the cells of each type interact with the other types of cells to which
      they connect.  There could be thousands of these different kinds of
      interactions.  Then, finally, comes the hardest part: we&#39;ll also
      have to understand how our billions of brain cells are organized into
      societies. To do this, we&#39;ll need to develop many new theories and
      organizational concepts. The more we can find out about how our brains
      evolved from those of simpler animals, the easier that task will be.</p>
