      Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
      &mdash;<i>Albert Einstein</i></blockquote>

    <p>
      This book tries to explain how minds work. How can intelligence emerge
      from nonintelligence? To answer that, we&#39;ll show that you can
      build a mind from many little parts, each mindless by itself.</p>

    <p>
      I&#39;ll call <em>Society of Mind</em> this scheme in which each mind
      is made of many smaller processes. These we&#39;ll call agents. Each
      mental agent by itself can only do some simple thing that needs no
      mind or thought at all. Yet when we join these agents in societies
      &mdash; in certain very special ways &mdash; this leads to true
      intelligence.</p>

    <p>
      There&#39;s nothing very technical in this book. It, too, is a society
      &mdash; of many small ideas. Each by itself is only common sense, yet
      when we join enough of them we can explain the strangest mysteries of
      mind.  One trouble is that these ideas have lots of
      cross-connections. My explanations rarely go in neat, straight lines
      from start to end. I wish I could have lined them up so that you could
      climb straight to the top, by mental stair-steps, one by one. Instead
      they&#39;re tied in tangled webs.</p>

    <p>
      Perhaps the fault is actually mine, for failing to find a tidy base of
      neatly ordered principles. But I&#39;m inclined to lay the blame upon
      the nature of the mind: much of its power seems to stem from just the
      messy ways its agents cross-connect. If so, that complication can&#39;t
      be helped; it&#39;s only what we must expect from evolution&#39;s
      countless tricks.</p>

    <p>
      What can we do when things are hard to describe? We start by sketching
      out the roughest shapes to serve as scaffolds for the rest; it
      doesn&#39;t matter very much if some of those forms turn out partially
      wrong. Next, draw details to give these skeletons more lifelike flesh.
      Last, in the final filling-in, discard whichever first ideas no longer
      fit.</p>

    <p>
      That&#39;s what we do in real life, with puzzles that seem very
      hard. It&#39;s much the same for shattered pots as for the cogs of great
      machines.  Until you&#39;ve seen some of the rest, you can&#39;t make
      sense of any part.</p>
