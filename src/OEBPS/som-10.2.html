<h2>10.2 reasoning about amounts</h2>

    <p>
      What do those egg and water jar experiments say about our growth
      from infancy? Let&#39;s consider several explanations.</p>

    <p>
      QUANTITY: Perhaps the younger children simply don&#39;t yet
      understand the basic concept of quantity: that the amount of liquid
      remains the same.</p>

    <p>
      In the next few sections I&#39;ll argue that we don not learn one
      single, underlying <em>concept of quantity.</em> Instead, each
      person must construct a multileveled agency, which we&#39;ll call
      the Society-of-More, that finds different ways to deal with
      quantities.</p>

    <p>
      EXTENT: The younger children seem unduly influenced by the larger
      extent of space taken up by the spread-out eggs and taller water
      column.</p>

    <p>
      That cannot be the whole story because most adults, too, judge that
      there&#39;s more water in the taller jar &mdash; if they merely see
      the final scene, without knowing from where the water was poured!
      Here are a few other theories about the younger child&#39;s
      judgment:</p>

    <p>
      REVERSIBILITY: The older children pay more attention to what they
      think remains the same &mdash; while younger ones are more concerned
      with what has changed.
      
      CONFINEMENT: An older child knows that the amount of water stays the
      same, if none was ever added or removed or lost or spilled.</p>

    <p>
      LOGIC: Perhaps younger children have not yet learned to apply the
      kinds of reasoning that one would need to understand the concept of
      quantity.</p>

    <p>
      Every one of these explanations has some truth in it, but none reach
      the heart of the issue. It is clear that the older children know
      more about such matters and can do more complex kinds of
      reasoning. But there is ample evidence that most younger children
      also possess enough of the required abilities. For example, we can
      describe the experiment without actually doing it at all or we can
      perform it out of the child&#39;s sight, behind a cardboard
      screen. Then, when we explain what is happening, quite a few of the
      younger children will say, <em>Of course they&#39;ll be the
	same.</em></p>

    <p>
      Then what is the difficulty? Evidently, the younger children possess
      the ideas they need but don&#39;t know when to apply them! One might
      say that they lack adequate knowledge about their knowledge, or that
      they have not acquired the checks and balances required to select or
      override their hordes of agents with different perceptions and
      priorities. It is not enough to be able to use many kinds of
      reasoning;</p>

    <p>
      one also must know which to use in different circumstances! Learning
      is more than the mere accumulation of skills. Whatever we learn,
      there is always more to learn &mdash; about how to use what was
      already learned.</p>
