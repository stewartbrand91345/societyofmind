<h2>2.6 Are people machines?</h2>

  

  
  
    <p>
      Many people feel offended when their minds are likened to computer
      programs or machines. We&#39;ve seen how a simple tower-building skill
      can be composed of smaller parts. But could anything like a real mind be
      made of stuff so trivial?</p>

    <p>
      <em>Ridiculous,</em> most people say. <em>I certainly don&#39;t feel
        like a machine!</em></p>

    <p>
      But if you&#39;re not a machine, what makes you an authority on what it
      feels like to be a machine? A person might reply, <em>I think, therefore
        I know how the mind works.</em> But that would be suspiciously like
      saying, <em>I drive my car, therefore I know how its engine works.</em>
      Knowing how to use something is not the same as knowing how it works.</p>

    <p>
      <em>But everyone knows that machines can behave only in lifeless,
        mechanical ways.</em></p>

    <p>
      This objection seems more reasonable: indeed, a person ought to feel
      offended at being likened to any trivial machine. But it seems to me
      that the word <em>machine</em> is getting to be out of date. For
      centuries, words like <em>mechanical</em> made us think of simple
      devices like pulleys, levers, locomotives, and typewriters. (The
      word <em>computerlike</em> inherited a similar sense of pettiness, of
      doing dull arithmetic by little steps.) But we ought to recognize that
      we&#39;re still in an early era of machines, with virtually no idea of
      what they may become. What if some visitor from Mars had come a billion
      years ago to judge the fate of earthly life from watching clumps of
      cells that hadn&#39;t even learned to crawl? In the same way, we cannot
      grasp the range of what machines may do in the future from seeing
      what&#39;s on view right now.</p>

    <p>
      Our first intuitions about computers came from experiences with machines
      of the 1940s, which contained only thousands of parts. But a human brain
      contains billions of cells, each one complicated by itself and connected
      to many thousands of others. Present-day computers represent an
      intermediate degree of complexity; they now have millions of parts, and
      people already are building billion-part computers for research on
      Artificial Intelligence. And yet, in spite of what is happening, we
      continue to use old words as though there had been no change at all. We
      need to adapt our attitudes to phenomena that work on scales never
      before conceived. The term <em>machine</em> no longer takes us far
      enough.</p>

    <p>
      But rhetoric won&#39;t settle anything. Let&#39;s put these arguments
      aside and try instead to understand what the vast, unknown mechanisms of
      the brain may do. Then we&#39;ll find more self-respect in knowing what
      wonderful machines we are.</p>
