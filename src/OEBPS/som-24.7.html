<h2>24.7 picture-frames</h2>

    


    <p>
      Whenever we see a thing so utterly new that it resembles nothing
      we&#39;ve ever seen before, this means that none of our prelearned
      frames will fit it very well. But this rarely happens to adults. For
      example, we have each accumulated enough room-frames to represent
      most rooms we&#39;re likely to see, such as kitchens, bedrooms,
      offices, factories, and concert halls; one of these will usually
      match whichever place we happen to be. Besides, we can almost always
      use a less specific frame that fits most any room at all &mdash; a
      frame with terminals that correspond to nothing more than ceiling,
      floor, and walls. Then each of those six surfaces could be
      represented, in turn, by a subframe that has terminals for several
      vaguely defined regions. To be specific, let&#39;s employ our
      direction-neme idea and divide each surface &mdash; for ceiling,
      floor, and each of the walls &mdash; into zones that correspond to
      the nine regions of an interaction-square. A typical wall might then
      be represented in this fashion:</p>

    <p>
      In spite of its simplicity, we can represent quite a lot of
      information with this scheme. It provides enough structure to recall
      later that
      <em>there was a window toward the left, some shelves high to the
	right side of the wall, and a table to the right.</em> If this
      does not seem precise enough, the fact is that we usually
      don&#39;t remember things so exactly, except when they attract
      special attention; normally it would be enough to know only
      roughly where that television was, and we could assume by default
      that it was supported by the tabletop. It takes surprisingly few
      such observations to enable us to tell, later, whether much has
      been changed.</p>

    <p>
      Given more time, one could keep noticing more details and include
      them by attaching additional subframes. This would overcome the
      limitations of starting with so few terminals. For example, one
      might notice that the window is closer to the shelf than to the
      television set, and closer to the ceiling line than to either the
      shelf or the television set. And if the outline of the desk and
      television set reminds you of a goatlike animal, your representation
      can include that fact.</p>

    <p>
      Suppose you had first assumed this to be a living room but later
      recognized the table to be a kitchen table? Must you undo all the
      work you&#39;ve done, to activate a different kitchen-frame and
      start all over again? No, because later we&#39;ll see a convenient
      way to switch over to another frame &mdash; while still retaining
      what was learned so far. The trick will be to make all our frames
      for different rooms share the same terminals, so that when we
      interchange those frames, the information stored in them remains.</p>
