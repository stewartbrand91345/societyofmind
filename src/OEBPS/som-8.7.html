<h2>8.7 fringes</h2>

    <p>
      It&#39;s hard to recognize a thing when you&#39;re presented with
      too much detail. To know that you are seeing a kite, it helps to
      look for paper, sticks, and string. But if you were to use a
      microscope, what you&#39;d perceive would not be properties of kites
      at all, but merely features of particular bits of paper, sticks or
      string. These might allow you to identify a particular kite but not
      to recognize any other kite. Past a certain level of detail, the
      more one sees, the less one can tell what one is seeing! The same
      applies to memories; they should weaken their attachments at lower
      levels of detail.</p>

    <p>
      Lower Band: Beyond a certain level of detail, increasingly complete
      memories of previous situations are increasingly difficult to match
      to new situations.</p>

    <p>
      To explain why K-lines need an upper-level fringe, let&#39;s return
      to that example in which our child originally learned how to build a
      tower &mdash; but now desires to build a house. Here, we could have
      another kind of difficulty if we remembered too much about our
      previous goals!</p>

    <p>
      Upper Band: Memories that arouse agents at too high a level would
      tend to provide us with goals that are not appropriate to the
      present situation.</p>

    <p>
      To see why our K-line memories should weaken their attachments above
      a certain level of detail, consider this most extreme form.  Suppose
      some memory were so complete that it made you relive, in every
      detail, some perfect moment of your past. That would erase your
      present <em>you</em> &mdash; and you&#39;d forget what you had asked
      your memory to do!</p>

    <p>
      Both fringing effects serve to make our memories more relevant to
      our present purposes. The central level-band helps us find general
      resemblances between remembered events and present
      circumstances. The lower fringe supplies additional details but does
      not force them upon us. We use them only <em>by default</em> when
      actual details are not supplied. Similarly, the upper fringe recalls
      to mind some memories of previous goals, but again, we&#39;re not
      forced to use them except by default, when present circumstances do
      not impose more compelling goals. Seen this way, we can think of the
      lower fringe as concerned with the structures of things, and we can
      think of the upper fringe as involved with the functions of
      things. The lower levels represent <em>objective</em> details of
      reality; the upper levels represent our <em>subjective</em> concerns
      with goals and intentions.</p>

    <p>
      How could the fringes of the same K-line lie in two such different
      realms? Because in order to think, we need intimate connections
      between things and goals &mdash; between structures and their
      functions.  What use would thinking be at all, unless we could
      relate each thing&#39;s details to our plans and intentions?
      Consider how often the English language employs the selfsame words
      for things and for their purposes. What tools would you use, when
      building your house, to saw and clamp and glue your wood? That&#39;s
      obvious: you&#39;d use a saw and a clamp and some glue! Behold the
      wondrous force of those
      <em>meanings</em>: no sooner do we hear the noun form of a word than
      our agents strain to perform the acts that correspond to it as a
      verb. This phenomenon of connecting means with ends is not confined
      to language &mdash; we&#39;ll see many other instances of it in
      other kinds of agencies &mdash; but language may allow such linking
      with the least constraint.</p>
