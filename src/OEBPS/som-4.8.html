<h2>4.8 ideals</h2>

    <p>
      We usually reserve the word <em>ideals</em> to refer to how we
      think we ought to conduct our ethical affairs. But I&#39;ll use
      the term in a broader sense, to include the standards we
      maintain &mdash; consciously or otherwise &mdash; for how we
      ought to think about ordinary matters.</p>

    <p>
      We&#39;re always involved with goals of varying spans and scales. What
      happens when a transient inclination clashes with a long-term
      self-ideal? What happens, for that matter, when our ideals disagree
      among themselves, as when there is an inconsistency between the things
      we want to do and those we feel we ought to do? These disparities give
      rise to feelings of discomfort, guilt, and shame. To lessen such
      disturbances, we must either change the things we do &mdash; or change
      the ways we feel. Which should we try to modify &mdash; our immediate
      wants or our ideals? Such conflicts must be settled by the multilayered
      agencies that are formed in the early years of the growth of our
      personalities.</p>

    <p>
      In childhood, our agencies acquire various types of goals. Then we grow
      in overlapping waves, in which our older agencies affect the making of
      the new. This way, the older agencies can influence how our later ones
      will behave. Outside the individual, similar processes go on in every
      human community; we find children <em>taking after</em> persons other
      than themselves by absorbing values from their parents, families, and
      peers, even from the heroes and villains of mythology.</p>

    <p>
      Without enduring self-ideals, our lives would lack coherence. As
      individuals, we&#39;d never be able to trust ourselves to carry out our
      personal plans. In a social group, no one person would be able to trust
      the others. A working society must evolve mechanisms that stabilize
      ideals &mdash; and many of the social principles that each of us regards
      as personal are really <em>long-term memories</em> in which our cultures
      store what they have learned across the centuries.</p>
