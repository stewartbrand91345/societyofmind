<h2>1.5 Common Sense</h2>

    <p>
      We found a way to make our tower builder out of parts. But Builder is
      really far from done. To build a simple stack of blocks, our child&#39;s
      agents must accomplish all these other things.</p>

    <p>
      <em>See</em> must recognize its blocks, whatever their color, size, and place
      &mdash; in spite of different backgrounds, shades, and lights, and even
      when they&#39;re partially obscured by other things.</p>

    <p>
      Then, once that&#39;s done, <em>Move</em> has to guide the arm and hand through
      complicated paths in space, yet never strike the tower&#39;s top or hit
      the child&#39;s face.</p>

    <p>
      And think how foolish it would seem, if <em>Find</em> were to see, and Grasp were
      to grasp, a block supporting the tower top!</p>

    <p>
      When we look closely at these requirements, we find a bewildering world
      of complicated questions. For example, how could Find determine which
      blocks are still available for use? It would have to
      <em>understand</em> the scene in terms of what it is trying to do. This
      means that we&#39;ll need theories both about what it means to
      understand and about how a machine could have a goal. Consider all the
      practical judgments that an actual Builder would have to make. It would
      have to decide whether there are enough blocks to accomplish its goal
      and whether they are strong and wide enough to support the others that
      will be placed on them.</p>

    <p>
      What if the tower starts to sway? A real builder must guess the cause.
      It is because some joint inside the column isn&#39;t square enough? Is
      the foundation insecure, or is the tower too tall for its width? Perhaps
      it is only because the last block was placed too roughly.</p>

    <p>
      All children learn about such things, but we rarely ever think about
      them in our later years. By the time we are adults we regard all of this
      to be simple <em>common sense.</em> But that deceptive pair of words
      conceals almost countless different skills.</p>

    <p>
      Common sense is not a simple thing. Instead, it is an immense society of
      hard-earned practical ideas &mdash; of multitudes of life-learned rules
      and exceptions, dispositions and tendencies, balances and checks.</p>

    <p>
      If common sense is so diverse and intricate, what makes it seem so
      obvious and natural? This illusion of simplicity comes from losing touch
      with what happened during infancy, when we formed our first
      abilities. As each new group of skills matures, we build more layers on
      top of them. As time goes on, the layers below become increasingly
      remote until, when we try to speak of them in later life, we find
      ourselves with little more to say than <em>I don&#39;t know.</em></p>
