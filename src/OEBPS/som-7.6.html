<h2>7.6 reinforcement and reward</h2>

    <p>
      One thing is sure: we always find it easier to do things we&#39;ve done
      before. What happens in our minds to make that possible? Here&#39;s one
      idea: In the course of solving some problem, certain agents must have
      aroused certain other agents. So let&#39;s take <em>reward</em> to mean
      that if agent A has been involved in arousing agent B, the effect of
      reward is, somehow, to make it easier for A to arouse B in the future
      and also, perhaps, to make it harder for A to arouse other agents. At
      one time, I was so taken with this idea that I designed a machine called
      the Snarc, which learned according to this principle; it was composed of
      forty agents, each connected to several others, more or less at random,
      through a <em>reward</em> system that, when activated after each
      success, made each agent more likely to rearouse the same recipients at
      later times.</p>

    <p>
      We presented this machine with problems like learning to find a path
      through a maze while avoiding a hostile predator. It quickly learned to
      solve easy problems but never could learn to solve hard problems like
      building towers or playing chess. It became clear that, in order to
      solve complicated problems, any machine of limited size must be able to
      reuse its agents in different ways in different contexts &mdash; as See
      must do when involved in two concurrent tasks. But when the Snarc tried
      to learn its way through a complicated maze, a typical agent might
      suggest a good direction to move in at one moment, then suggest a bad
      direction at another moment. Later, when we rewarded it for doing
      something we liked, both those decisions became more likely &mdash; and
      all those <em>goods</em> and <em>bads</em> tended to cancel one another
      out!</p>

    <p>
      This poses a dilemma in designing machines that learn
      by <em>reinforcing</em> the connections between agents. In the course of
      solving a hard problem, one will usually try several bad moves before
      finding a good one &mdash; for this is virtually what we mean by calling
      a problem <em>hard.</em>  To avoid learning those bad moves, we could
      design a machine to reinforce only what happened in the last few moments
      before success.  But such a machine would be able to learn only to solve
      problems whose solutions require just a few steps. Alternatively, we
      could design the reward to work over longer spans of time; however, that
      would not only reward the bad decisions along with the good but would
      also erase other things that it had previously learned to do. We cannot
      learn to solve hard problems by indiscriminately reinforcing agents or
      their connections. Why is it that among all the animals, only the
      great-brained relatives of man can learn to solve problems that require
      many steps or involve using the same agencies for different purposes?
      We&#39;ll seek the answer in the policies our agencies use for
      accomplishing goals.</p>

    <p>
      You might argue that a beaver goes through many steps to build a
      dam, as does a colony of termites when it builds its complex
      castle nest. However, these wonderful animals do not learn such
      accomplishments as individuals but use the procedures that have
      become encoded in their species&#39; genes over millions of
      years of evolution. You cannot train a beaver to build a termite
      nest or teach termites to build beaver dams.</p>
