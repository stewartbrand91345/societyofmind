<h2>3.5 destructiveness</h2>

    <p>
      In any actual child&#39;s mind, the urge to Play competes with other
      demanding urges, such as Eat and Sleep. What happens if another agent
      wrests control from Play, and what happens to the agents Play
      controlled?</p>

    <p>
      Suppose that our child is called away, no matter whether by someone else
      or by an internal urge like Sleep. What happens to the processes
      remaining active in the mind? One part of the child may still want to
      play, while another part wants to sleep. Perhaps the child will knock
      the tower down with a sudden, vengeful kick. What does it mean when
      children make such scenes? Is it that inner discipline breaks down to
      cause those savage acts? Not necessarily. Those <em>childish</em> acts
      might still make sense in other ways.</p>

    <p>
      Smashing takes so little time that Wrecker, freed from Play&#39;s
      constraint, need persist for only one more kick to gain the satisfaction
      of a final crash.</p>

    <p>
      Though childish violence might seem senseless by itself, it serves to
      communicate frustration at the loss of goal. Even if the parent scolds,
      that just confirms how well the message was transmitted and received.
      
      Destructive acts can serve constructive goals by leaving fewer problems
      to be solved. That kick may leave a mess outside, yet tidy up the
      child&#39;s mind.</p>

    <p>
      When children smash their treasured toys, we shouldn&#39;t ask for the
      reason why &mdash; since no such act has a single cause. Besides, it
      isn&#39;t true in a human mind that, when Sleep starts, then Play must
      quit and all its agents have to cease. A real child can go to bed
      &mdash; yet still build towers in its head.</p>
