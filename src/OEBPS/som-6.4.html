<h2>6.4 B-Brains</h2>

    <p>
      There is one way for a mind to watch itself and still keep track of
      what&#39;s happening. Divide the brain into two parts, A and B. Connect
      the A-brain&#39;s inputs and outputs to the real world &mdash; so it can
      sense what happens there. But don&#39;t connect the B-brain to the outer
      world at all; instead, connect it so that the A-brain is the
      B-brain&#39;s world!</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch6/6-1.png"/>
    <p>
      Now A can see and act upon what happens in the outside world &mdash;
      while B can <em>see</em> and influence what happens inside A. What uses
      could there be for such a B? Here are some A-activities that B might
      learn to recognize and influence.</p>

    <p>
      A seems disordered and confused.  Inhibit that activity.  A appears to
      be repeating itself.  Make A stop. Do something else.  A does something
      B considers good.  Make A remember this.  A is occupied with too much
      detail.  Make A take a higher-level view A is not being specific enough.
      Focus A on lower-level details.</p>

    <p>
      This two-part arrangement could be a step toward having a more
      <em>reflective</em> mind-society. The B-brain could do experiments with
      the A-brain, just as the A-brain can experiment with the body or with
      the objects and people surrounding it. And just as A can attempt to
      predict and control what happens in the outer world, B can try to
      predict and control what A will do. For example, the B-brain could
      supervise how the A-brain learns, either by making changes in A directly
      or by influencing A&#39;s own learning processes.</p>

    <p>
      Even though B may have no concept of what A&#39;s activities mean in
      relation to the outer world, it is still possible for B to be useful to
      A.</p>

    <p>
      This is because a B-brain could learn to play a role somewhat like that
      of a counselor, psychologist, or management consultant, who can assess a
      client&#39;s mental strategy without having to understand all the
      details of that client&#39;s profession. Without having any idea of what
      A&#39;s goals are, B might be able to learn to tell when A is not
      accomplishing them but only going around in circles or wandering,
      confused because certain A-agents are repeating the same things over and
      over again. Then B might try some simple remedies, like suppressing some
      of those A-agents. To be sure, this could also result in B&#39;s
      activities becoming nuisances to A. For example, if A had the goal of
      adding up a long column of numbers, B might start to interfere with this
      because, from B&#39;s point of view, A appears to have become trapped in
      a repetitive loop. This could cause a person accustomed to more variety
      to find it difficult to concentrate on such a task and complain of being
      bored.</p>

    <p>
      To the extent that the B-brain knows what is happening in A, the entire
      system could be considered to be partly <em>self-aware.</em> However, if
      we connect A and B to <em>watch</em> each other too closely, then
      anything could happen, and the entire system might become unstable. In
      any case,</p>

    <p>
      there is no reason to stop with only two levels; we could connect a
      C-brain to watch the B-brain, and so on.</p>
