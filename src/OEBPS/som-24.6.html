<h2>24.6 direction-nemes</h2>

    <p>
      When you think about an object in a certain place, many different
      processes go on inside your mind. Some of your agencies know the
      visual direction in which that object lies, others can direct your
      hand to reach toward it, and yet other agencies anticipate how it
      would feel if it touched your skin. It is one thing to know that a
      block has flat sides and right angles, another to be able to
      recognize a block by sight, and yet another to be able to shape your
      hand to grasp that shape or recognize it from feeling it in your
      grasp. How do so many different agencies communicate about places
      and shapes?</p>

    <p>
      No one yet knows how shapes and places are represented in the brain.
      The agencies that do such things have been evolving since animals
      first began to move. Some of those agencies must be involved with
      postures of the arm and hand, others must represent what we discover
      from the images inside our eyes, and yet others must represent the
      relations between our bodies and the objects that surround us.</p>

    <p>
      How can we use so many different kinds of information at once? In
      the following sections I&#39;ll propose a new hypothesis to deal
      with this: that many agencies inside our brains use frames whose
      terminals are controlled by interaction-square arrays. Only now
      we&#39;ll use those square-arrays not to represent the interactions
      of different causes, but to describe the relations between closely
      related locations. For example, thinking of the appearance of a
      certain place or object would involve arousing a squarelike family
      of frames, each of which in turn represents a detailed view of the
      corresponding portion of that scene. If we actually use such
      processes, this could explain some psychological phenomena.</p>

    <p>
      If you were walking through a circular tube, you could scarcely keep
      from thinking in terms of bottom and top and sides &mdash; however
      vaguely their boundaries are defined. Without a way to represent the
      scene in terms of familiar parts, you&#39;d have no well-established
      thinking skills to apply to it.</p>

    <p>
      The diagram is meant to suggest that we represent directions and
      places by attaching them to a special set of pronome-like agents
      that we shall call <em>direction-nemes.</em> Later we&#39;ll see how
      these might be involved in surprisingly many realms of thought.</p>
