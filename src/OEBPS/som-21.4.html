<h2>21.4 communication among agents</h2>

    <p>
      If agents had huge minds like ours, they could talk the way people
      do &mdash; and Add could say, <em>Please, Get an apple and Put it in
	the pail.</em>  Perhaps our largest agencies can deal with messages
      like that, but smaller agencies like Get cannot interpret such
      expressions because they&#39;re much too specialized to understand
      complicated wants and needs. Then how could Get know what to get
      &mdash; in order to find an apple rather than a block, a fork, or a
      paper doll? To examine this problem, we&#39;ll have to make some
      assumptions about what happens in a listener&#39;s mind. For the
      moment, let&#39;s simply assume that the result is to activate a
      Builder-like society with these ingredients:</p>

    <p>
      At first sight, it seems as though all these agents are involved
      with the apple and the pail. But a closer look shows only the
      low-level agents Look-for and Grasp are actually concerned with the
      physical aspects of actual objects; all the others are
      merely <em>middle-level managers.</em> For example, the agent Get
      doesn&#39;t actually <em>get</em> anything; it only turns on Find
      and Grasp at the proper time. To be sure, Look-for will need some
      information about what to look for &mdash; that is, about an
      apple&#39;s appearance, and Move will need information about the
      apple&#39;s actual location. Nevertheless, we&#39;ll see that this
      information can become available to those agents without any need
      for messages from Get. To see how agents can operate without
      explicit messages, let&#39;s compare two ordinary language
      descriptions of how to put an apple into a pail. Our first script
      mentions each object explicitly in every line, the way one might
      speak to a novice.</p>

    <p>
      Look for an apple. Move the arm and hand to the apple&#39;s
      location. Prepare the hand to grasp an apple-shaped object.  Grasp
      the apple. Now look for the pail. Move the arm and hand to the
      pail&#39;s location. Release the hand&#39;s grip on the apple.</p>

    <p>
      Now let&#39;s rewrite this description in a style more typical of
      normal speech.</p>

    <p>
      
      Look for an apple. Move the arm and hand to its location.  Prepare
      the hand to grasp an object of that shape. Grasp it.  Now look for
      the pail. Move the arm and hand to its location.  Release the
      hand&#39;s grip.</p>

    <p>
      This second script uses the words <em>apple</em> and <em>pail</em>
      only once. This is how we usually speak; once something has been
      mentioned, we normally don&#39;t use its name again. Instead,
      whenever possible, we replace a name by a pronoun word. In the next
      few sections I&#39;ll argue that it is not only in language that we
      replace things with pronounlike tokens; we also do this in many
      other forms of thought. It could scarcely be otherwise, because in
      order to make sense to us, our sentences must mirror the structures
      and methods we use for managing our memories.</p>
