<h2>17.2 attachment-learning</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose a child were playing in a certain way, and a stranger
      appeared and began to scold and criticize. The child would become
      frightened and disturbed and try to escape. But if, in the same
      situation, the child&#39;s parent arrived and proceeded to scold and
      criticize, the result would be different. Instead of being
      frightened, the child would feel guilty and ashamed, and instead of
      trying to escape, the child would try to change what it was doing,
      in attempts to seek reassurance and approval.</p>

    <p>
      I suspect that these two scenarios engage different learning
      mechanisms. In the encounter with the forbidding visitor, the child
      might learn <em>I should not try to achieve my present goal in this
	kind of situation.</em> But when scolded by someone to whom the
      child is
      <em>attached,</em> the child might learn <em>I ought not to want to
	achieve that goal at all!</em> In the first case, it is a matter
      of learning which goal to pursue in which circumstance; in the
      second instance, it is more a question of what goals one should
      have. If my theory is right, the presence of the attachment-person
      actually switches the effect of learning over to different sets of
      agents. To see the difference, let&#39;s make a small
      reformulation of the concept of a difference-engine to represent
      three different kinds of learning that an infant might use.</p>

    <p>
      In the case of ordinary forms of failure or success signals, the
      learner modifies the methods used to reach the goal.
      
      In the case of fear-provoking disturbances, the learner may modify
      the description of the situation itself.</p>

    <p>
      In the case of attachment-related failure or reward signals, the
      learner modifies which goals are considered worthy of pursuit.</p>

    <p>
      So far as I know, this is a new theory about attachment. It asserts
      that there are particular types of learning that can proceed only in
      the presence of the particular individuals to whom one has become
      attached.</p>
