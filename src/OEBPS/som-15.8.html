<h2>15.8 anatomy of memory</h2>











    <p>
      What controls the working of the mind from one moment to the next?
      How do we keep our place when doing complicated jobs, so that when
      interrupted from outside &mdash; or by another thought from inside
      &mdash; we can <em>get back</em> to where we were, instead of having
      to start all over again? How do we keep in mind which things
      we&#39;ve tried and what we&#39;ve learned along the way, so that we
      don&#39;t go round and round in loops?</p>

    <p>
      No one yet knows how memories control themselves inside our brain;
      perhaps each major agency has somewhat different processes, each
      suited to the special kinds of jobs it does. The diagram below
      suggests some of the sorts of memory-machinery we&#39;d expect to
      find inside a typical large agency.</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch15/15-3.png"/>

    <p>
      We&#39;ll assume that every substantial agency has several
      <em>micromemory-units,</em> each of which is a sort of temporary
      K-line that can quickly store or restore the state of many of the
      agents in that agency. Each agency also has several <em>short-term
	memory-units,</em> which can, in turn, store or restore the states
      of the micromemories themselves. When any of these temporary
      memory-units are reused, the information that was stored in them is
      erased &mdash; unless it has somehow been <em>transferred</em> into
      more <em>permanent</em> or <em>long-term</em> memory-systems. There
      is good evidence that, in human brains, the processes that transfer
      information into long-term memory are very slow, requiring time
      intervals that range from minutes to hours.  Accordingly, most
      temporary memories are permanently lost.</p>

    <p>
      A growing child acquires many ways to control all these mechanisms.
      Accordingly, our diagram includes the flow of information among the
      other agencies. Since this memory-controlling agency must also learn
      and remember, our diagram includes a memory-system for it as well.</p>
