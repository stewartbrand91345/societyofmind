<h2>28.8 overlapping minds</h2>

    <p>
      Consider the popular idea that a person is capable of two kinds of
      thinking at once &mdash; a <em>right brain</em> kind and a <em>left
	brain</em> kind &mdash; as though there were two different
      individuals inside each human brain.  This raises some odd
      questions, since there are many other ways to draw imaginary
      boundaries through brains.</p>

    <p>
      If you agree that each person has both a left-brain mind and
      right-brain mind, then you must also agree that each person also has
      a front-brain mind and a back-brain mind! Can a single large mind
      contain so many smaller ones, with overlapping boundaries? It makes
      sense to think of part of a structure as being a <em>thing</em> in
      its own right only when the relationships among parts of that
      structure have some significant type of coherency. Before you&#39;d
      say that a certain arbitrary section of brain contains a mind,
      you&#39;d want to have some evidence that what happens inside that
      boundary is something you would consider to be a mind.</p>

    <p>
      The less another entity resembles you, the less it means for you to
      say that it, like you, must have a mind. Do our very smallest
      agencies have minds? No, because it would make no more sense to say
      this than to say that two trees form a forest or that two bricks
      form a wall. But there are indeed some agencies inside our brains
      that do have humanlike abilities to solve, by themselves, some types
      of problems that we regard as hard. For example, your agencies for
      locomotion, vision, and language may contain within their boundaries
      some processes that are quite as intricate as those <em>you</em> use
      for your own conscious thought. Possibly, some of those processes
      are actually more <em>conscious</em> than you are yourself, in the
      sense that they maintain and use even more complete records of their
      own internal activities. Yet what happens in those agencies is so
      sealed off that you have no direct experience of how <em>you</em>
      distinguish a cat from a dog, retrace <em>your</em> last few steps,
      or listen and talk without knowing how <em>you</em> do it.</p>

    <p>
      All this suggests that it can make sense to think there exists,
      inside your brain, a society of different minds. Like members of a
      family, the different minds can work together to help each other,
      each still having its own mental experiences that the others never
      know about. Several such agencies could have many agents in common,
      yet still have no more sense of each other&#39;s interior activities
      than do people whose apartments share opposite sides of the same
      walls.  Like tenants in a rooming house, the processes that share
      your brain need not share one another&#39;s mental lives.</p>

    <p>
      If each of us contains several such mini-minds, could any special
      exercise help put them all <em>in closer touch</em>? Certainly there
      are ways to become selectively aware of processes that are usually
      not conscious at all. But becoming aware of everything that happens
      in brains would leave no room for thought. And the reports of those
      who claim to have developed such skills seem singularly
      uninformative. If anything, they demonstrate that it&#39;s even
      harder than we think to penetrate those unresisting barriers.</p>
