<h2>18.3 chaining</h2>

    <p>
      Why is chaining so important? Because, as we&#39;ve just seen, it
      seems to work in many different realms. More than that, it can also
      work in several ways at once, inside the same world. Consider how,
      with no apparent mental strain at all, we can first imagine the same
      kind of arch to be a bridge, a tunnel, or a table &mdash; and then
      we can imagine chains of these, according to quite different views:</p>

    <p>
      Chaining seems to permeate not only how we reason, but how we think
      of structures in space and time. We find ourselves involved with
      chains whenever we imagine or explain. Why does the ability to build
      mental chains help us solve so many different kinds of problems?
      Perhaps because all sorts of chains share common properties like
      these:</p>

    <p>
      When chains are stressed, the weakest links break first.  To fix a
      broken chain, one needs to repair only its broken links.  No part of
      a chain can be removed if both ends remain fixed.  If pulling A
      makes B move, there must be a chain connecting A and B.</p>

    <p>
      Each separate rule seems common sense, at least when we apply it to
      a solid thing like a bridge, a fence, or a physical chain. But why
      do chains apply so well to insubstantial <em>lines of thought</em>?
      It is because there&#39;s such a good analogy between how chains can
      break and how reasoning can fail.</p>
