<h1>17 Development</h1>
<h2>17.1 sequences of teaching-selves</h2>

    <p>
      Up to this point we&#39;ve portrayed the mind as made of scattered
      fragments of machinery. But we adults rarely see ourselves that way;
      we have more sense of unity. In the next few sections we&#39;ll
      speculate that this coherency is acquired over many <em>stages of
	development.</em>  Each new stage first works under the guidance of
      previous stages, to acquire some knowledge, values, and goals. Then
      it proceeds to change its role and becomes a teacher to subsequent
      stages.</p>

    <p>
      How could an early stage teach anything to a later one when it knows
      less than its student does? As every teacher knows, this is not as
      hard as it might seem. For one thing, it is usually easier to
      recognize a solution to a problem than to discover a solution; this
      is what we called the <em>puzzle principle.</em> A teacher need not
      know how to solve a problem to be able to reward a student for doing
      so or to help the student search for solutions by imparting ways to
      sense when progress has been made. Even better is for the teacher to
      impart new goals to the student.</p>

    <p>
      How could an early stage of development affect the goals of a later
      stage? One simple way would be to give each later stage some access
      to the goals of earlier stages; however, those early goals would
      then remain infantile. How could later stages develop more advanced
      goals? Shortly we&#39;ll see an astonishing answer: it is not
      necessary to formulate more advanced goals at <em>higher levels</em>
      of organization because they are likely to develop spontaneously, as
      subgoals of relatively simple goals.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, it wouldn&#39;t be safe to send the student into the
      world equipped with systems that have not yet been tried and
      tested. A safer strategy would be to keep each new stage suppressed
      &mdash; that is, incapable of controlling the child&#39;s actual
      behavior &mdash; until it passes tests to verify that it is at least
      as capable as its predecessor. This could explain some of those
      apparently sudden <em>spurts</em> in our children&#39;s development
      &mdash; for example, in episodes of rapid growth of language
      skills. That apparent speed could be illusory if it were merely the
      end result of longer, hidden projects carried out silently inside
      the mind.</p>

    <p>
      Returning to our sense of Self, how could so many steps and stages
      lead to any sense of unity? Why wouldn&#39;t they lead us, instead,
      to feel increasingly fragmentary and dispersed? I suspect the secret
      is that after each old stage&#39;s work is done, its structure still
      remains available for further use. These remnants of our prior
      selves provide us with a powerful resource: whenever one&#39;s
      present mind gets confused, it can exploit what once was used by
      earlier minds.  Even though we weren&#39;t as smart then as we are
      now, we can be sure that every stage once had, in its turn, some
      workable ways to manage things.</p>

    <p>
      One&#39;s present personality cannot share many of the thoughts of
      all one&#39;s older personalities &mdash; and yet it has some sense
      that they exist. This is one reason why we feel that we possess an
      inner Self &mdash; a sort of ever-present person-friend, inside the
      mind, whom we can always ask for help.</p>
