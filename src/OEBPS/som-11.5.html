<h2>11.5 sensing similarities</h2>

    <p>
      Our ways to think depend in part on how we&#39;re raised. But at
      the start, much more depends upon the wiring in our brains. How
      do those microscopic features work to influence what happens in
      our mental worlds? The answer is, our thoughts are largely
      shaped by which things seem most similar. Which colors seem the
      most alike?  Which forms and shapes, which smells and tastes,
      which timbres, pitches, pains and aches, which feelings and
      sensations seem most similar?  Such judgments have a huge effect
      at every stage of mental growth &mdash; since what we learn
      depends on how we classify.</p>

    <p>
      For example, a child who classified each fire just by the color of
      its light might learn to be afraid of everything of orange hue. Then
      we&#39;d complain that the child had <em>generalized</em> too
      much. But if that child classified each flame, instead, by features
      that were never twice the same, that child would often be burned
      &mdash; and we&#39;d complain that it hadn&#39;t generalized enough.</p>

    <p>
      Our genes supply our bodies with many kinds of sensors &mdash;
      external event-detecting agents &mdash; each of which sends signals
      to the nervous system when it detects certain physical
      conditions. We have sensory-agents in our eyes, ears, nose, and
      mouth that discern light, sound, odors, and tastes; we have agents
      in the skin that sense pressure, touch, vibration, heat, and cold;
      we have internal agents that sense tensions in our muscles, tendons,
      and ligaments; and we have many other sensors of which we&#39;re
      normally unaware, such as those that detect the direction of gravity
      and sense the amounts of various chemicals in different parts of the
      body.</p>

    <p>
      The agents that sense the colors of light in human eyes are much
      more complex than the <em>redness agents</em> of our toy
      machine. But this is not the reason that simple machine can&#39;t
      grasp what Redness means to us &mdash; for neither can the sense
      detectors in our human eyes. For just as there is nothing to say
      about a single point, there&#39;s nothing to be said about an
      isolated sensory signal. When our Redness, Touch, or Toothache
      agents send their signals to our brains, each by itself can only
      say, <em>I&#39;m here.</em> The rest of what such
      signals <em>mean</em> to us depends on how they&#39;re linked to all
      our other agencies.</p>

    <p>
      In other words, the <em>qualities</em> of signals sent to brains
      depend only on relationships &mdash; the same as with the shapeless
      points of space. This is the problem Dr. Johnson faced when creating
      definitions for his dictionary: each separate word
      like <em>bitter,</em> <em>bright,</em> <em>salt,</em> or
      <em>sweet</em> attempts to speak about a quality of a sensory
      signal. But all that a separate signal can do is announce its
      own activity &mdash; perhaps with some expression of
      intensity. Your tooth can&#39;t ache (it can only send signals);
      only you can ache, once your higher-level agencies interpret
      those signals. Beyond the raw distinctiveness of every separate
      stimulus, all other aspects of its character or quality &mdash;
      be it of touch, taste, sound, or light &mdash; depend entirely
      on its relationships with the other agents of your mind.</p>
