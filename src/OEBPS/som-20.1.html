<h1>20 Context And Ambiguity</h1>
<h2>20.1 ambiguity</h2>


    <p>
      We often find it hard to <em>express our thoughts</em> &mdash; to
      summarize our mental states or put our ideas into words. It is
      tempting to blame this on the ambiguity of words, but the problem is
      deeper than that.</p>

    <p>
      Thoughts themselves are ambiguous!</p>

    <p>
      At first, one might complain that that&#39;s impossible. <em>I&#39;m
	thinking exactly what I&#39;m thinking; there&#39;s no way it
	could be otherwise. And this has nothing to do with whether I can
	express it precisely.</em> But <em>what you&#39;re thinking
	now</em> is itself inherently ambiguous. If we interpret it to
      mean the states of all your agencies, that would include much that
      cannot be <em>expressed</em> simply because it is not accessible
      to your language-agency. A more modest interpretation of <em>what
	you&#39;re thinking now</em> would be a partial indication of the
      present states of some of your higher-level agencies. But the
      significance of any agency&#39;s state depends on how it is likely
      to affect the states of other agencies. This implies that in order
      to <em>express</em> your present state of mind, you have to
      partially anticipate what some of your agencies are about to
      do. Inevitably, by the time you&#39;ve managed to express
      yourself, you&#39;re no longer in the state you were before; your
      thoughts were ambiguous to begin with, and you never did succeed
      in expressing them but merely replaced them with other thoughts.</p>

    <p>
      This is not just a matter of words. The problem is that our states
      of mind are usually subject to change. The properties of physical
      things tend to persist when their contexts are changed &mdash; but
      the <em>significance</em> of a thought, idea, or partial state of
      mind depends upon which other thoughts are active at the time and
      upon what eventually emerges from the conflicts and negotiations
      among one&#39;s agencies. It is an illusion to assume a clear and
      absolute distinction between <em>expressing</em> and
      <em>thinking,</em> since expressing is itself an active process that
      involves simplifying and reconstituting a mental state by detaching
      it from the more diffuse and variable parts of its context.</p>

    <p>
      The listener, too, must deal with ambiguity. You understand <em>I
	wrote a note to my sister,</em> despite the fact that the
      word <em>note</em> could mean a short letter or comment, a
      banknote, a musical sound, an observation, a distinction, or a
      notoriety. If all our separate words are ambiguous by themselves,
      why are sentences so clearly understood? Because the context of
      each separate word is sharpened by the other words, as well as by
      the context of the listener&#39;s recent past. We can tolerate the
      ambiguity of words because we are already so competent at coping
      with the ambiguity of thoughts.</p>
