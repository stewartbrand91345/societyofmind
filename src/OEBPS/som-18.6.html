<h2>18.6 magnitude from multitude</h2>

    <p>
      We like to think of reasoning as rational &mdash; yet we often
      represent our arguments as fights between adversaries positioned to
      determine which can wield the greater strength or force. Why do we
      use such energetic and aggressive images of weakness, strength,
      defeat, and victory, of boxing in and breaking down an enemy&#39;s
      defense? Why don&#39;t we just use cool, clear, faultless reasoning
      to prove we are right? The answer is that we rarely need to know
      that anything is absolutely wrong or right; instead, we only want to
      choose the best of some alternatives.</p>

    <p>
      Here are two different strategies for deciding whether one group of
      reasons should be considered <em>stronger</em> than another. The
      first strategy tries to compare opposing arguments in terms of
      magnitudes, by analogy to how two physical forces interact:</p>

    <p>
      Strength from Magnitude: When two forces work together, they add to
      form a single larger force. But when two forces oppose each other
      directly, their strengths subtract.</p>

    <p>
      Our second strategy is simply to count how many different reasons
      you can find for choosing each alternative:</p>

    <p>
      Strength from Multitude: The more reasons we can find in favor of a
      particular decision, the more confidence we can have in it. This is
      because if some of those reasons turn out to be wrong, other reasons
      may still remain.</p>

    <p>
      Whichever strategy we use, we tend to speak of the winning argument
      as the <em>stronger</em> one. But why do we use the same word
      <em>strong</em> for two such different strategies? It is because we
      use them both for the same purpose: to reduce the likelihood of
      failure. It comes out the same in the end, whether we base a
      decision on a single
      <em>strong</em> argument &mdash; that is, one unlikely to be wrong
      &mdash; or on several weaker arguments, in hopes that they won&#39;t
      fail all at once.</p>

    <p>
      What makes us so prone to formulate our reasoning in terms of
      conflicting adversaries? It must be partly cultural, but some of it
      could also be based on inheritance. When we use architectural
      metaphors that speak of arguments as not supported properly, we
      could be exploiting structures that evolved within our spatial
      agencies.  Similarly, when we represent our reasoning in terms of
      battling adversaries, we might be exploiting the use of agencies
      that first evolved for physical defense.</p>
