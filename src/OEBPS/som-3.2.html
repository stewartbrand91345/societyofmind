<h2>3.2 Noncompromise</h2>

    <p>
      To settle arguments, nations develop legal systems, corporations
      establish policies, and individuals may argue, fight, or compromise
      &mdash; or turn for help to mediators that lie outside themselves. What
      happens when there are conflicts inside minds?</p>

    <p>
      Whenever several agents have to compete for the same resources, they are
      likely to get into conflicts. If those agents were left to themselves,
      the conflicts might persist indefinitely, and this would leave those
      agents paralyzed, unable to accomplish any goal. What happens then?
      We&#39;ll assume that those agents&#39; supervisors, too, are under
      competitive pressure and likely to grow weak themselves whenever their
      subordinates are slow in achieving their goals, no matter whether
      because of conflicts between them or because of individual incompetence.</p>

    <p>
      The Principle of Noncompromise: The longer an internal conflict persists
      among an agent&#39;s subordinates, the weaker becomes that agent&#39;s
      status among its own competitors. If such internal problems aren&#39;t
      settled soon, other agents will take control and the agents formerly
      involved will be <em>dismissed.</em></p>

    <p>
      So long as playing with blocks goes well, Play can maintain its strength
      and keep control. In the meantime, though, the child may also be growing
      hungry and sleepy, because other processes are arousing the agents Eat
      and Sleep. So long as Eat and Sleep are not yet strongly activated, Play
      can hold them both at bay. However, any conflict inside Play will weaken
      it and make it easier for Eat or Sleep to take over. Of course, Eat or
      Sleep must conquer in the end, since the longer they wait, the stronger
      they get.</p>

    <p>
      We see this in our own experience. We all know how easy it is to fight
      off small distractions when things are going well. But once some trouble
      starts inside our work, we become increasingly impatient and
      irritable. Eventually we find it so hard to concentrate that the least
      disturbance can allow another, different, interest to take control.</p>

    <p>
      Now, when any of our agencies loses the power to control what other
      systems do, that doesn&#39;t mean it has to cease its own internal
      activity.  An agency that has lost control can continue to work inside
      itself &mdash; and thus become prepared to seize a later
      opportunity. However, we&#39;re normally unaware of all those other
      activities proceeding deep inside our minds.</p>

    <p>
      Where does it stop, this process of yielding control to other agencies?
      Must every mind contain some topmost center of control? Not
      necessarily. We sometimes settle conflicts by appealing to superiors,
      but other conflicts never end and never cease to trouble us.</p>

    <p>
      At first, our principle of noncompromise may seem too
      extreme. After all, good human supervisors plan ahead to avoid
      conflicts in the first place, and &mdash; when they can&#39;t
      &mdash; they try to settle quarrels locally before appealing to
      superiors. But we should not try to find a close analogy between
      the low-level agents of a single mind and the members of a human
      community. Those tiny mental agents simply cannot know enough to
      be able to negotiate with one another or to find effective ways
      to adjust to each other&#39;s interference. Only larger agencies
      could be resourceful enough to do such things. Inside an actual
      child, the agencies responsible for Building and Wrecking might
      indeed become versatile enough to negotiate by offering support
      for one another&#39;s goals. <em>Please, Wrecker, wait a moment
      more till Builder adds just one more block: it&#39;s worth it
      for a louder crash!</em></p>
