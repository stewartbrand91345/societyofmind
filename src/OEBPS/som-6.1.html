<h1>6 Insight And Introspection</h1>
<h2>6.1 consciousness</h2>

    <p>
      In real life, you often have to deal with things you don&#39;t
      completely understand. You drive a car, not knowing how its engine
      works.  You ride as passenger in someone else&#39;s car, not knowing how
      that driver works. Most strange of all, you drive your body and your
      mind, not knowing how your own self works. Isn&#39;t it amazing that we
      can think, not knowing what it means to think? Isn&#39;t it remarkable
      that we can get ideas, yet not explain what ideas are?</p>

    <p>
      In every normal person&#39;s mind there seem to be some processes that
      we call consciousness. We usually regard them as enabling us to know
      what&#39;s happening inside our minds. But this reputation of
      self-awareness is not so well deserved, because our conscious thoughts
      reveal to us so little of what gives rise to them.</p>

    <p>
      Consider how a driver guides the immense momentum of a motorcar, not
      knowing how its engine works or how its steering wheel directs it to the
      left or right. Yet when one comes to think of it, we drive our bodies in
      much the same way. So far as conscious thought is concerned, you turn
      yourself to walk in a certain direction in much the way you steer a car;
      you are aware only of some general intention, and all the rest takes
      care of itself. To change your direction of motion is actually quite
      complicated. If you simply took a larger or smaller step on one side,
      the way you would turn a rowboat, you would fall toward the outside of
      the turn. Instead, you start to turn by making yourself fall toward the
      inside &mdash; and then use centrifugal force to right yourself on the
      next step.  This incredible process involves a huge society of muscles,
      bones, and joints, all controlled by hundreds of interacting programs
      that even specialists don&#39;t yet understand. Yet all you think is,
      Turn that way,</p>

    <p>
      and your wish is automatically fulfilled.</p>

    <p>
      We give the name <em>signals</em> to acts whose consequences are not
      inherent in their own character but have merely been assigned to them.
      When you accelerate your car by pressing on the gas pedal, this is not
      what does the work; it is merely a signal to make the engine push the
      car. Similarly, rotating the steering wheel is merely a signal that
      makes the steering mechanism turn the car. The car&#39;s designer could
      easily have assigned the pedal to steer the car or made the steering
      wheel control its speed. But practical designers try to exploit the use
      of signals that already have acquired some significance.</p>

    <p>
      Our conscious thoughts use signal-signs to steer the engines in our
      minds, controlling countless processes of which we&#39;re never much
      aware. Not understanding how it&#39;s done, we learn to gain our ends by
      sending signals to those great machines, much as the sorcerers of older
      times used rituals to cast their spells.</p>
