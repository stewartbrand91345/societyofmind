<h2>6.14 confusion</h2>

    <p>
      It&#39;s mainly when our other systems start to fail that we engage the
      special agencies involved with what we call <em>consciousness.</em>
      Accordingly, we&#39;re more aware of simple processes that don&#39;t
      work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly. This means that we
      cannot trust our offhand judgments about which of the things we do are
      simple, and which require complicated machinery. Most times, each
      portion of the mind can only sense how quietly the other portions do
      their jobs.</p>
