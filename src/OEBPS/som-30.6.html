<h2>30.6 freedom of will</h2>

    <p>
      We each believe that we possess an Ego, Self, or Final Center of
      Control, from which we choose what we shall do at every fork in the
      road of time. To be sure, we sometimes have the sense of being
      dragged along despite ourselves, by internal processes which, though
      they come from within our minds, nevertheless seem to work against
      our wishes. But on the whole we still feel that we can choose what
      we shall do. Whence comes this sense of being in control? According
      to the modern scientific view, there is simply no room at all
      for <em>freedom of the human will.</em> Everything that happens in
      our universe is either completely determined by what&#39;s already
      happened in the past or else depends, in part, on random
      chance. Everything, including that which happens in our brains,
      depends on these and only on these:</p>

    <p>
      A set of fixed, deterministic laws. A purely random set of
      accidents.</p>

    <p>
      There is no room on either side for any third alternative. Whatever
      actions we may <em>choose,</em> they cannot make the slightest
      change in what might otherwise have been &mdash; because those
      rigid, natural laws already caused the states of mind that caused us
      to decide that way.  And if that choice was in part made by chance
      &mdash; it still leaves nothing for us to decide.</p>

    <p>
      Every action we perform stems from a host of processes inside our
      minds. We sometimes understand a few of them, but most lie far
      beyond our ken. But none of us enjoys the thought that what we do
      depends on processes we do not know; we prefer to attribute our
      choices to volition, will, or self-control. We like to give names to
      what we do not know, and instead of wondering how we work, we simply
      talk of being <em>free.</em>  Perhaps it would be more honest to
      say, <em>My decision was determined by internal forces I do not
	understand.</em> But no one likes to feel controlled by something
      else.</p>

    <p>
      Why don&#39;t we like to feel compelled? Because we&#39;re largely
      made of systems designed to learn to achieve their goals. But in
      order to achieve any long-range goals, effective difference-engines
      must also learn to resist whatever other processes attempt to make
      them change those goals. In childhood, everyone learns to recognize,
      dislike, and resist various forms of aggression and
      compulsion. Naturally we&#39;re horrified to hear about agents that
      hide in our minds and influence what we decide.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, both alternatives are unacceptable to self-respecting
      minds. No one wants to submit to laws that come to us like the whims
      of tyrants who are too remote for any possible appeal. And it&#39;s
      equally tormenting to feel that we&#39;re a toy to mindless chance,
      caprice, or probability &mdash; for though these leave our fate
      unfixed, we&#39;d still not play the slightest part in choosing what
      shall come to be. So, though it&#39;s futile to resist, we continue
      to regard both Cause and Chance as intrusions on our freedom of
      choice. There remains only one thing to do: we add another region to
      our model of our mind. We imagine a third alternative, one easier to
      tolerate; we imagine a thing called
      <em>freedom of will,</em> which lies beyond both kinds of
      constraint.</p>
