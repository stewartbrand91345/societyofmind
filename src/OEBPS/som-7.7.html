<h2>7.7 local responsibility</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose that Alice, who owns a wholesale store, asks the
      manager, Bill, to increase sales. Bill instructs the salesman,
      Charles, to sell more radios. Charles secures a large order, on
      profitable terms. But then the firm can&#39;t actually deliver
      those radios, because they are in short supply. Who is to blame?
      Alice would be justified in punishing Bill, whose job it was to
      verify the inventory. The question is, should Charles be
      rewarded? From Alice&#39;s viewpoint, Charles&#39;s actions have
      only disgraced the firm. But from Bill&#39;s viewpoint, Charles
      succeeded in his mission to get sales, and it wasn&#39;t his
      fault that this failed to accomplish his supervisor&#39;s
      goal. Consider this example from two perspectives &mdash; call
      them <em>local reward</em> and <em>global reward.</em></p>

    <p>
      The Local scheme rewards each agent that helps accomplish its
      supervisor&#39;s goal. So Bill rewards Charles, even though
      Charles&#39;s action served no higher-level goal.</p>

    <p>
      The Global scheme rewards only agents that help accomplish top-level
      goals. So Charles gets no reward at all.</p>

    <p>
      It is easy to invent machinery to embody local learning policies, since
      each assignment of credit depends only on the relation between an agent
      and its supervisor. It is harder to implement a global learning scheme
      because this requires machinery to find out which agents are connected
      all the way to the original goal by unbroken chains of accomplished
      subgoals. The local scheme is relatively generous to Charles by
      rewarding him whenever he accomplishes what is asked of him. The global
      scheme is much more parsimonious. It dispenses no credit whatever to
      Charles, even though he does as his supervisor requests, unless his
      action also contributes to the top-level enterprise.  In such a scheme,
      agents will often learn nothing at all from their
      experiences. Accordingly, global policies lead to learning more slowly.</p>

    <p>
      Both schemes have various advantages. The cautiousness of the global
      policy is appropriate when mistakes are very dangerous or when the
      system has plenty of time. This can lead to more
      <em>responsible</em> behavior &mdash; since it could make Charles learn,
      in time, to check the inventory for himself instead of slavishly obeying
      Bill. The global policy does not permit one to justify a bad action
      with <em>I was only obeying the orders of my superior.</em> On the other
      side, the local policy can lead to learning many more different things
      at once, since each agent can constantly improve its ability to achieve
      its local goals, regardless of how they relate to those of other
      portions of the mind.  Surely our agencies have several such
      options. Which ones they use may depend, from moment to moment, upon the
      states of other agencies whose job it is to learn, themselves, which
      learning strategies to use, depending on the circumstances.</p>

    <p>
      The global scheme requires some way to distinguish not only which
      agents&#39; activities have helped to solve a problem, but also which
      agents helped with which subproblems. For example, in the course of
      building a tower, you might find it useful to push a certain block aside
      to make room for another one. Then you&#39;d want to remember that
      pushing can help in building a tower &mdash; but if you were to conclude
      that pushing is a generally useful thing to do, you&#39;d never get
      another tower built. When we solve a hard problem, it usually is not
      enough to say that what a certain agent did was <em>good</em>
      or <em>bad</em> for the entire enterprise; one must make such judgments
      depend, to some extent, on the local circumstances &mdash; that is, on
      how the work of each agent helped or hindered the work of related
      agents. The effect of rewarding an agent must be to make that agent
      react in ways that help to accomplish some specific goal &mdash; without
      too much interference with other, more important goals. All this is
      simple common sense, but in order to pursue it further, we&#39;ll have
      to clarify our language. We have all experienced the pursuit of goals,
      but experience is not the same as understanding.  What is a goal, and
      how can a machine have one?</p>
