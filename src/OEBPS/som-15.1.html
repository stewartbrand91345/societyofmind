<h1>15 Consciousness And Memory</h1>
<h2>15.1 momentary mental state</h2>


    <p>
      We normally assume that consciousness is knowing what happens in our
      minds right at the present time. In the next few sections, I&#39;ll
      argue that consciousness does not concern the present, but the past:
      it has to do with how we think about the records of our recent
      thoughts. But how can thinking about thoughts be possible at all?</p>

    <p>
      There&#39;s something queer about describing consciousness: whatever
      people mean to say, they just can&#39;t seem to make it
      clear. It&#39;s not like feeling confused or ignorant. Instead, we
      feel we know what&#39;s going on but can&#39;t describe it
      properly. How could anything seem so close, yet always keep beyond
      our reach?</p>

    <p>
      There is a simple sense in which thinking about a thought is not so
      different from thinking about an ordinary thing. We know that
      certain agencies must learn to recognize &mdash; and even name
      &mdash; the feel of touching a hand or an ear. Similarly, there must
      be other agencies that learn to recognize events inside the brain
      &mdash; for example, the activities of the agencies that manage
      memories. And those, I claim, are the bases of the awarenesses we
      recognize as consciousness.</p>

    <p>
      There is nothing peculiar about the idea of sensing events inside
      the brain. Agents are agents &mdash; and it is as easy for an agent
      to be wired to detect a brain-caused brain-event, as to detect a
      world-caused brain-event. Indeed, only a small minority of our
      agents are connected directly to sensors in the outer world, like
      those that send signals from the eye or skin; most of the agents in
      the brain detect events inside the brain. But here we&#39;re
      especially concerned with agents that are engaged in using and
      changing our most recent memories. These lie at the roots of
      consciousness.</p>

    <p>
      Why, for example, do we become less conscious of some things when we
      become more conscious of others? Surely this is because some
      resource is approaching some limitation &mdash; and I&#39;ll argue
      that it is our limited capacity to keep good records of our recent
      thoughts. Why, for example, do thoughts so often seem to flow in
      serial streams? It is because whenever we run out of room, the
      records of our recent thoughts must then displace those of our older
      ones. And why are we so unaware of how we get our new ideas? Because
      whenever we solve hard problems, our short-term memories become so
      involved with doing that that they have neither time nor space for
      keeping detailed records of what they themselves have done.</p>

    <p>
      What happens when we try to think about our most recent thoughts?
      We examine our recent memories. But these were already involved in
      what we were <em>thinking</em> about &mdash; and any self-inspecting
      probe is prone to change just what it&#39;s looking at. Then the
      system is likely to break down. It is hard enough to describe
      something with a stable shape; it is even harder to describe
      something that changes its shape before our eyes; and it is
      virtually impossible to speak of the shapes of things that change
      into something else each time we try to think of them. And
      that&#39;s what happens when we try to think about our present
      thoughts &mdash; since each such thought must change our mental
      state! Would any process not become confused that alters what
      it&#39;s looking at? In such a fix, how could one ever hope to be
      articulate?</p>
