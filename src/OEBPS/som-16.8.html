<h2>16.8 stimulus vs. simulus</h2>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch16/16-10.png"/>

    <p>
      We&#39;ve just seen how one agency could exploit another one by
      focusing its attention on some object in the outer world. Thus
      Thirst can make Get reach for a cup &mdash; provided there&#39;s a
      cup in view. But what about that fantasy about Professor Challenger,
      in which there was no real villain on the scene, but just a memory?
      Apparently one agency can activate another merely by imagining a
      stimulus! One way to do this would be for Anger to somehow construct
      an artificial picture that other agencies like See
      could <em>see.</em> If this were done with enough detail, the other
      agents couldn&#39;t tell that the image wasn&#39;t genuine.
      However, to construct the sorts of images we see on television
      screens, we&#39;d have to activate a million different sensory
      nerves, which would require a huge amount of machinery. Besides, we
      could do more with less: A fantasy need not reproduce the fine
      details of an actual scene. It need only reproduce that scene&#39;s
      effect on other agencies.</p>

    <p>
      Fantasies usually <em>depict</em> occurrences we&#39;ve never
      seen. They need no detailed, realistic images &mdash; since the
      higher levels of the mind don&#39;t really <em>see</em> things
      anyway! Instead, they deal with summaries of signals that come from
      sensory experience and are condensed at several levels along the
      way. In the fantasy of Professor Challenger, there was no need to
      see any of the actual features of Challenger himself; it was enough
      to reproduce some sense of how his presence once affected us.</p>

    <p>
      What kind of process could reproduce the effect of an imaginary
      presence? Although scientists don&#39;t yet know the fine details of
      how our vision-systems work, we can assume that they involve a
      number of levels, perhaps like this:</p>

    <p>
      First, rays of light excite sensors in our retinas.  Then, other
      agents detect boundaries and textures.  Then, yet other agents
      describe regions, shapes, and forms.  Then, some memory-frames
      recognize familiar objects.  Next, we recognize structural
      relationships among those objects.  Finally, we relate these
      structures to functions and goals.</p>

    <p>
      Accordingly, it would be possible to produce illusions by operating
      at any of these levels. Most difficult of all would be to construct
      a
      <em>picture-image</em> by arousing, from inside the brain, the
      million lowest-level sensor-agents involved in real-world
      vision. Perhaps the simplest way of all would be to force just the
      highest-level vision-agents into whichever states would result from
      seeing a certain scene: this would only require some suitable
      K-lines. Let&#39;s call this a simulus &mdash; a reproduction of
      only the higher-level effects of a stimulus. A simulus at the very
      highest levels could lead a person to recollect virtually no details
      about a remembered object or event, yet be able to apprehend and
      contemplate its most significant structures and relationships while
      experiencing a sense of its presence. A simulus may have many
      advantages over a picture-image. Not only can it work more swiftly
      while using less machinery, but we can combine the parts of several
      simuli to imagine things we have never seen before &mdash; and even
      to imagine things that couldn&#39;t possibly exist.</p>
