<h2>12.11 how causes work</h2>

    <p>
      It&#39;s wonderful when we can find out something&#39;s cause. A
      tower is high because each of its separate blocks contribute height;
      it stands because those blocks are adequately firm and wide. A baby
      cries because it wants food. A stone falls down because it&#39;s
      pulled by gravity. Why can we explain so many things in terms of
      causes and effects? Is it because there is a cause for everything
      &mdash; or do we merely learn to ask only about the kinds of
      happenings that have causes? Is it that causes don&#39;t exist at
      all but are inventions of our minds? The answer is all of the
      above. Causes are indeed made up by minds &mdash; but only work in
      certain parts of certain worlds.</p>

    <p>
      What are causes, anyway? The very concept of a cause involves a
      certain element of style: a causal explanation must be brief. Unless
      an explanation is compact, we cannot use it as a prediction. We
      might agree that X causes Y, if we see that Y depends more on X than
      on most other things. But we wouldn&#39;t call X a cause of Y if
      describing X involved an endless discourse that mentioned virtually
      everything else in the world.</p>

    <p>
      There can&#39;t be any <em>causes</em> in a world in which
      everything that happens depends more or less equally upon everything
      else that happens.</p>

    <p>
      Indeed, it wouldn&#39;t make any sense to talk about
      a <em>thing</em> in such a world. Our very notion of
      a <em>thing</em> assumes some constellation of properties that stays
      the same (or changes in ways we can predict) when other things
      around it change. When Builder moves a block, that block&#39;s
      location will change &mdash; but not its color, weight, material,
      size, or shape. How convenient that our world lets us change a
      thing&#39;s location while leaving so many other properties
      unchanged! This lets us predict the effect of motions so well that
      we can chain them into combinations never tried before &mdash; yet
      still predict their principal effects. Furthermore, because our
      universe has three <em>dimensions,</em> we can easily predict the
      effect of combining several actions from knowing only their effects
      in each of those three dimensions.</p>

    <p>
      Why does a block retain its size and shape when it is moved? It is
      because we&#39;re fortunate enough to live within a universe in
      which effects are localized. A solid object with a stable shape can
      exist only because its atoms <em>stick together</em> so tightly that
      when you move some of them, the others are pulled along. But this
      can happen only in a universe whose force laws work in close accord
      with the
      <em>nearnesses</em> of time and space &mdash; in other words, a
      universe in which entities that are far apart have much less effect
      on each other than ones that are close together. In worlds without
      constraints like that, there could be no <em>things</em>
      or <em>causes</em> for us to know.</p>

    <p>
      To know the cause of a phenomenon is to know, at least in principle,
      how to change or control some aspects of some entities without
      affecting all the rest.</p>

    <p>
      The most useful kinds of causes our minds can discern are
      predictable relationships between the actions we can take and the
      changes we can sense. This is why animals tend to evolve sensors
      that detect stimuli that can be affected by those animals&#39; own
      actions.</p>
