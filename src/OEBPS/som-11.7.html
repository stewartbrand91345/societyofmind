<h2>11.7 predestined learning</h2>

    <p>
      It would be wonderful if we could classify all behavior into two
      types:
      <em>built-in</em> and <em>learned.</em> But there simply is no
      clear-cut boundary between heredity and environment. Later, I&#39;ll
      describe an agency that is sure to learn one particular thing: to
      recognize human beings. But if such an agency is destined to end up
      with a certain particular behavior, is it reasonable to say that it
      learns? Since this type of activity appears to have no common name,
      we&#39;ll call it <em>predestined learning.</em></p>

    <p>
      Every child eventually learns to reach for food. To be sure, each
      different child lives through a different history
      of <em>reaching-act</em> experiences. Nevertheless, according to our
      theory of <em>nearness models of space,</em> all those children will
      end up with generally similar results because that outcome is
      constrained by the nearness relations of real-world space. Why make
      the brain use a tedious learning process when the final outcome
      seems so clear? Why not build in the answer genetically? One reason
      could be that learning is more economical. It would require an
      enormous store of genetic information to force each separate nerve
      cell to make precisely the right connections, whereas it would
      require much less information to specify the construction of a
      learning machine designed to unscramble whatever irregularities
      result from a less constrained design.</p>

    <p>
      This is why it isn&#39;t sensible to ask, <em>Is the child&#39;s
	conception of space acquired or inherited?</em> We acquire our
      conceptions of space by using agencies that learn in accord with
      processes determined by inheritance. These agencies proceed to
      learn from experience &mdash; but the outcomes of their learning
      processes are virtually predestined by the spatial geometry of our
      body parts. This kind of mixture of adaptation and predestination
      is quite common in biology, not only in the brain&#39;s
      development but in that of the rest of the body as well.  How, for
      example, do our genes control the shapes and sizes of our bones?
      They may begin with some relatively precise specification of the
      types and location of certain early cells. But that alone would
      not be adequate for animals that themselves have to adapt to
      different conditions; therefore those early cells must themselves
      be programmed to adapt to the various chemical and mechanical
      influences that may later be imposed on them. Such systems are
      essential for our development, since our organs must become able
      to perform various tightly constrained activities, yet also be
      able to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>

    <p>
      Perhaps the growth of the Society-of-More is another instance of
      predestined learning, for it seems to develop in every normal child
      without much outside help. It seems clear that this complex agency
      is not built directly by inborn genes; instead, we each discover our
      own ways to represent comparisons &mdash; yet we all arrive at much
      the same final outcome. Presumably, genetic hints must help with
      this by supplying new layers of agents at roughly the right times
      and places.</p>
