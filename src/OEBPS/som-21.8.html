<h2>21.8 attention</h2>

    <p>
      When several objects move at once, it&#39;s hard to keep track of
      them all.  This also seems to be the case in every other realm of
      thought; the more things we think about, the harder it is to pay
      attention to them all. We&#39;re forced to focus on a few while
      losing track of all the rest.  What causes these phenomena? I&#39;ll
      argue that they&#39;re aspects of the processes we use to control
      our short-term memories. These skills develop over time; an adult
      can do things with memories that infants cannot do at all, such as
      remembering details of an action&#39;s purpose and trajectory, and
      how various obstacles were overcome. An infant, though, can barely
      keep track of what it&#39;s holding in one hand and is likely to
      forget what&#39;s in its other hand.</p>

    <p>
      How does memory-control begin? Perhaps our infants first acquire
      control over a single pronome, which gives them the ability to keep
      in mind a <em>temporary polyneme.</em> This amounts to being able to
      maintain only a single <em>object of attention</em>; let&#39;s call
      it IT. Now even the ability to keep track of a single IT requires
      the development of certain skills of memory-control, for it takes
      the normal infant several months to become able to tolerate even a
      small interruption without losing its previous focus of interest.</p>

    <p>
      One kind of interruption comes, for example, when watching a ball
      that happens to roll behind a box. To a very young infant, that IT
      will simply disappear from mind. An older infant will remember IT
      and expect the ball soon to reappear; we can see this in the way the
      older infant&#39;s eyes look toward the far side of the box. If the
      ball does not soon reappear, the older child will actively reach
      around the box for it, which shows that the child has maintained
      some sort of representation of IT. Another variety of interruption
      can come from inside the child&#39;s own mind, from refocusing on
      the same object, but at a different level of detail. For example,
      when a young child concentrates upon a doll&#39;s shoe, it may
      forget its original concern with the doll itself. Later, that
      concern with the shoe may be replaced, in turn, when the baby
      becomes occupied with the end of the shoelace.</p>

    <p>
      But what&#39;s an IT? The ability to focus attention could start
      with some machinery for keeping track of simple polynemes for
      object-things. In later stages, an IT could represent more complex
      processes or scripts that keep track of entire Trans-actions with
      their various pronomes for Objects, Origins, Destinations,
      Obstacles, Trajectories, and Purposes. Eventually our ITs develop
      into complex systems of machinery that represent the things that
      are <em>on one&#39;s mind</em> at the moment. In later life, we
      become more able to maintain several ITs at once. This enables us to
      construct comparisons, predictions, and imaginary plans, and to
      begin to construct explanations in terms of chains of causes and
      reasons.</p>
