<h2>8.5 level-bands</h2>
      <p>&ldquo;Jack is flying his kite.&rdquo; What
      knowledge do you need to understand this? It helps to know that
      you can&#39;t fly kites without any wind. It helps to know how
      to fly a kite. You would understand it better if you knew how
      kites are made, or where they&#39;re found, or what they cost.
      Understanding never ends. It is remarkable how much we can
      imagine about Jack&#39;s activity. Neither you nor I have ever
      seen Jack&#39;s kite, nor do we know its color, shape, or size,
      and yet our minds supply details from memories of other kites
      we&#39;ve seen before. That sentence may have made you think of
      string, yet string wasn&#39;t mentioned. How does your mind
      arouse so many memories so quickly?  And how does your mind know
      not to arouse too many memories &mdash; something that could
      also lead to serious problems? To explain this, I&#39;ll
      introduce what I call the level-band theory.</p>

    <p>
      The basic idea is simple: we learn by attaching agents to K-lines,
      but we don&#39;t attach them all with equal firmness. Instead, we
      make strong connections at a certain level of detail, but we make
      weaker connections at higher and lower levels. A K-line for a kite
      might include some properties like these:</p>

    <p>
      Whenever we turn on this K-line, it tries to activate all these
      agents, but those near the fringes are attached as though by twice
      used tape and tend to retreat when other agents challenge them. If
      most of the kites you&#39;ve seen before were red and
      diamond-shaped, then when you hear about Jack&#39;s kite, those weak
      connections will lead you to assume that Jack&#39;s kite, too, is
      red and diamond-shaped. But if you should hear that Jack&#39;s kite
      is green, your weakly activated red-color agent memories will be
      suppressed by your strongly activated green-color agents. Let&#39;s
      call these kinds of weakly activated memories assumptions by
      default. Default assumptions, once aroused, stay active only when
      there are no conflicts. In psychological terms, they are things we
      assume when we have no particular reason to think otherwise.  Later
      we&#39;ll see that default assumptions embody some of our most
      valuable kinds of commonsense knowledge: knowing what is usual or
      typical. For example, they&#39;re why we all assume that Jack has
      hands and feet. If such assumptions turn out to be wrong, their weak
      connections allow them to be easily displaced when better
      information comes to mind.</p>
