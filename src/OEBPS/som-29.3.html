<h2>29.3 paranomes</h2>

    <p>
      What enables us to comprehend <em>Mary gives Jack the kite</em> in
      so many ways at once? Different meanings don&#39;t conflict when
      they apply to separate realms &mdash; but that can&#39;t be quite
      what&#39;s happening here, since the physical, social, and mental
      realms are closely linked in many ways. So now I&#39;ll argue just
      the opposite, that these meanings are so similar they don&#39;t
      conflict! Here is my hypothesis about what holds together all these
      aspects of our thoughts:</p>

    <p>
      Many of our higher level conceptual-frames are really parallel
      arrays of analogous frames, each active in a different realm.</p>

    <p>
      Consider all the different roles played by the Actor pronome of our
      sentence. In the physical realm, the Origin of give is Mary&#39;s
      hand. In the possessional realm of <em>give and take,</em> that
      Origin is in Mary&#39;s estate &mdash; since Mary can only give Jack
      what she owns. Similarly, in the physical realm, it is the kite
      itself that moves from Mary&#39;s hand to Jack&#39;s; however, in
      the realm of estates, the kite&#39;s ownership is what
      <em>changes hands.</em></p>

    <p>
      This suggests that certain pronomes can operate in several different
      realms at once. Let&#39;s call them <em>paranomes</em> to emphasize
      their parallel activities. When the language-agency activates some
      polynemes and paranomes, these agents run crosswise through the
      agencies of various realms to arouse several processes and frames at
      the same time; these correspond to different interpretations, in
      different realms, of the same phrase or sentence. Then, because each
      major agency contains its own memory-control system, the agencies
      within each realm can simultaneously apply their own methods for
      dealing with the corresponding aspect of the common topic of
      concern. In this way, a single language-phrase can at the same time
      evoke different processes involved with social dispositions, spatial
      images, poetical fancies, musical themes, mathematical structures
      &mdash; or any other assortment of types of thought that don&#39;t
      interfere too much with one another.</p>

    <p>
      This is not to say that all these different modes of thought will
      proceed independently of one another. Whenever any process gains
      momentary control over a paranome, many other processes can be
      affected. For example, one agency&#39;s memory-control process might
      thus cause the agencies in several other realms simultaneously to
      <em>blink</em> on and off their Origin and Destination
      paranomes. This would force the agencies active in each of those
      realms to focus upon whichever types of differences they then
      discern; then, in between such episodes, each agency can apply its
      own way of thinking to the corresponding topic, difference, or
      relationship. By using these cross-connecting polynemes and
      paranomes, the activity in each realm can proceed sometimes
      independently, yet at other times influence and be affected by what
      happens in the other realms.</p>
