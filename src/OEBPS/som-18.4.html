<h2>18.4 logical chains</h2>

    

    <p>
      <em>Logic</em> is the word we use for certain ways to chain
      ideas. But I doubt that pure deductive logic plays much of a role in
      ordinary thinking.  Here is one way to contrast logical reasoning
      and ordinary thinking.  Both build chainlike connections between
      ideas. The difference is that in logic there&#39;s no middle ground;
      a logic link is either there or not.  Because of this, a logical
      argument cannot have any <em>weakest link.</em></p>

    <p>
      Logic demands just one support for every link, a single, flawless
      deduction. Common sense asks, at every step, if all of what
      we&#39;ve found so far is in accord with everyday experience. No
      sensible person ever trusts a long, thin chain of reasoning. In real
      life, when we listen to an argument, we do not merely check each
      separate step;</p>

    <p>
      we look to see if what has been described so far seems plausible. We
      look for other evidence beyond the reasons in that argument.
      Consider how often we speak of reasoning in terms of structural or
      architectural expressions, as though our arguments were like the
      towers Builder builds:</p>

    <p>
      <em>Your argument is based on weak evidence.</em>
      <em>You must support that with more evidence.</em>
      <em>That argument is shaky. It will collapse.</em></p>

    <p>
      In this way, commonsense reasoning differs from <em>logical</em>
      reasoning.  When an ordinary argument seems weak, we may be able to
      support it with more evidence. But there is no way for a link inside
      a logic chain to use additional support; if it&#39;s not quite
      right, then it&#39;s absolutely wrong. Indeed, this weakness is
      actually the source of logic&#39;s own peculiar strength, because
      the less we base our conclusions on, the fewer possibilities can
      exist for weaknesses in our arguments!  This strategy serves
      mathematics well &mdash; but it doesn&#39;t help us much in dealing
      with uncertainties. We cannot afford to stake our lives on chains
      that fall apart so easily.</p>

    <p>
      I do not mean to say that there is anything wrong with logic; I only
      object to the assumption that ordinary reasoning is largely based on
      it. What, then, are the functions of logic? It rarely helps us get a
      new idea, but it often helps us to detect the weaknesses in old
      ideas.  Sometimes it also helps us clarify our thoughts by refining
      messy networks into simpler chains. Thus, once we find a way to
      solve a certain problem, logical analysis can help us find the most
      essential steps. Then it becomes easier to explain what we&#39;ve
      discovered to other people &mdash; and, also, we often benefit from
      explaining our ideas to ourselves. This is because, more often than
      not, instead of explaining what we actually did, we come up with a
      new formulation. Paradoxically, the moments in which we think
      we&#39;re being logical and methodical can be just the times at
      which we&#39;re most creative and original.</p>
