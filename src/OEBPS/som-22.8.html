<h2>22.8 interruptions</h2>

    <p>
      What enables us to tolerate an interruption and then return to our
      previous thoughts? This must engage the agents that control our
      short-term memories. It is important also to recognize that many
      interruptions come not only from outside, but also from inside the
      mind. For example, all but the simplest discourses make
      interruptions in the trains of thought they start. Consider this
      sentence:</p>

    <p>
      The thief who took the moon moved it to Paris.</p>

    <p>
      We can regard this as expressing one thought that is interrupted by
      another. The principal intention of the speaker is to express this
      Trans-frame:</p>

    <p>
      The thief moved the moon (from ?)  to Paris.  Actor Trans Object
      Origin Destination The speaker, realizing that the listener may not
      know who the thief was, interrupts the main sentence with
      a <em>relative clause</em> &mdash; <em>who took the moon</em>
      &mdash; to further describe that Actor thief. As it happens, this
      interrupting clause also has the form of a Trans-frame &mdash; so
      now the language-agency must deal with two such frames at once.</p>

    <p>
      Who took the moon (from ?)  (to?)  Actor Trans Object Origin
      Destination English tends to use certain wh words,
      like <em>which</em> and <em>who,</em> to interrupt a listener&#39;s
      language-agency and cause its short-term memories to temporarily
      store away some of their present pronome assignments. This provides
      the language-agency with more capacity to understand the
      interrupting phrase. In the case of the moon sentence, the
      word <em>who</em> instructs the listener to prepare to elaborate the
      description of the Actor thief. Once this is done, the
      language-agency can <em>re-member</em> its previous state in the
      process of understanding the main sentence. We can often tell when
      to use an interruption process even though the initial wh word is
      missing; however, this doesn&#39;t always work so well:</p>

    <p>
      The cotton clothing is made of is grown in the south.</p>

    <p>
      This sentence is confusing because the reader tends to treat the
      word
      <em>cotton</em> in <em>cotton clothing</em> as an adjective that
      modifies <em>clothing,</em> when the writer meant it as a noun. The
      same sentence is easier to understand when set in a larger context:</p>

    <p>
      Where do people grow the cotton that is used to make clothing?  ---
      The cotton clothing is made of is grown in the south.</p>

    <p>
      The first sentence activates the noun sense of <em>cotton</em> and
      asks a question about that subject. Now a question is really a sort
      of command: it makes the reader focus attention on a certain
      subject.  Here, it prepares the reader to add more structure to the
      representation of the cotton noun, so there is less need for an
      explicit interruption signal. Still, it is very curious how rarely
      we bother to use any signal at all for marking the end of an
      interrupting phrase. We never say a word that means <em>un-who.</em>
      Evidently, we&#39;re usually ready to assume that the interrupting
      phrase is complete.</p>
