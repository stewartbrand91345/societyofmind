<h2>8.9 knowledge-trees</h2>

    <p>
      If each K-line can connect to other K-lines, which, in turn, connect
      to others, then K-lines can form societies. But how can we make sure
      that this can serve our purposes, instead of becoming a great,
      disordered mess? What could guide them into representing useful
      hierarchies like these?</p>
<img class="illus" src="./illus/ch8/8-8.png"/>

    <p>
      To keep things orderly, we&#39;ll now apply that level-band idea
      again.  Remember that we first invented K-lines to link older agents
      together; then we invented level-bands to keep those K-lines from
      filling up with too much useless, unrelated stuff. Now we have the
      same problem again: when connecting new K-lines to old ones, we must
      keep them from including too much inappropriate detail. So why not
      try the same solution? Let&#39;s apply the level-band idea to the
      K-line trees themselves!</p>

    <p>
      When making a new K-line memory, do not connect it to all the
      K-lines active at the time but only to those that are active within
      a certain level-band.</p>

    <p>
      It might be supposed that this idea would be hard to apply unless we
      specify what <em>level</em> means. However, something like this will
      happen automatically, simply because the new K-line societies will
      tend to inherit whatever hierarchy already existed among the
      original agents that become connected to those K-lines. We&#39;ve
      actually seen two different ideas about this. In our Kite example,
      we talked about a description&#39;s <em>level of detail.</em> That
      is, we regarded it as more elevated to talk about <em>a sheet
	stretched across a frame</em> than to discuss the paper or the
      sticks themselves. In our Builder example, we talked about goals and
      considered the Tower Builder agent itself to be a level above the
      agents it exploits to solve its subproblems &mdash; agents like
      Begin and Add and End.</p>

    <p>
      This policy of connecting new K-lines to old ones must be used in
      moderation. Otherwise, no new agents would ever be included in our
      memories. Furthermore, it should not always be required to produce
      simple, orderly hierarchy-trees; for example, in the case of
      Builder, we found that both Move and See will often need one
      another&#39;s help.  Eventually, all of our knowledge-structures
      become entangled with various sorts of exceptions, shortcuts, and
      cross-connections. No matter: the level-band idea will still apply
      in general, since most of what we know will still be mainly
      hierarchical because of how our knowledge grows.</p>
