<h2>28.2 magnitude and marketplace</h2>

    <p>
      How can a hurt be canceled by a kiss? How can an insult <em>add</em>
      to injury? Why do we so often speak as though our wishes and desires
      were like forces, which increase one another&#39;s effects when
      they&#39;re aligned but cancel out when they&#39;re opposed?
      I&#39;ll argue that this is because, at every moment of our lives,
      we&#39;re forced to choose between alternatives we can&#39;t
      compare. Suppose, for example, that you must choose between two
      homes: one of them offers a mountain view; the other is closer to
      where you work. It really is a strange idea that two such unrelated
      things as nearness to work and beautiful scenery could be compared
      at all. But a person could instead assess that pleasant, restful
      view as worth a certain amount of travel time.  Instead of comparing
      the items themselves, you could simply compare how much time they
      seem to be worth.</p>

    <p>
      We turn to using quantities when we can&#39;t compare the qualities
      of things.</p>

    <p>
      This way, for better or for worse, we often assign some magnitude or
      price to each alternative. That tactic helps to simplify our lives
      so much that virtually every social community works out its own
      communal measure-schemes &mdash; let&#39;s call them currencies
      &mdash; that let its people work and trade in harmony, even though
      each individual has somewhat different personal goals. The
      establishment of a currency can foster both competition and
      cooperation by providing us with peaceful ways to divide and
      apportion the things we have to share.</p>

    <p>
      But who can set prices on things like time or measure the values of
      comfort and love? What makes our mental marketplaces work so well
      when emotional states seem so hard to compare? One reason is that no
      matter how different those mental conditions seem, they must all
      compete for certain limited resources &mdash; such as space, time,
      and energy &mdash; and these, to a rather large extent, are
      virtually interchangeable. For example, you&#39;d end up with
      essentially the same result whether you measure things in terms of
      food or time &mdash; because it takes time to find food, and each
      amount of food helps you survive for some amount of time. Thus the
      value we place on each commodity constrains, to some extent, the
      values we&#39;ll assign to many other kinds of goods. Because there
      are so many such constraints, once a community sets up a currency,
      that currency takes on a life of its own, and soon we start to treat
      our <em>wealth</em> as though it were a genuine commodity, a real
      substance that we can use, save, lend, or waste.</p>

    <p>
      In a similar way, a group of agencies inside the brain could exploit
      some <em>amount</em> to keep account of their transactions with one
      another. Indeed agencies need such techniques even more than people
      do, because they are less able to appreciate each other&#39;s
      concerns. But if agents had to <em>pay their way,</em> what might
      they use for currency? One family of agents might evolve ways to
      exploit their common access to some chemical that is available in
      limited quantities; another family of agents might contrive to use a
      quantity that doesn&#39;t actually exist at all, but whose amount is
      simply
      <em>computed.</em> I suspect that what we call the pleasure of
      success may be, in effect, the currency of some such scheme. To the
      extent that success is interchangeable with time or food or energy,
      it&#39;s useful to treat pleasure as equivalent to wealth.</p>
