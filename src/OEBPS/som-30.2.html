<h2>30.2 knowing and believing</h2>

    <p>
      We often speak as though we classify our thoughts into different
      types called facts, opinions, and beliefs.</p>

    <p>
      <ul>
	<li>The red object is on the table.</li>
	<li>I think the red block is on the table.</li>
	<li>I believe that the red block is on the table.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>
      How do these statements differ from one another? Some philosophers
      have argued that <em>knowing</em> must mean <em>true and justified
	belief.</em> However, no one has ever found a test to prove
      what&#39;s justified or true. For example, we all know that the sun
      rises in the morning. Once, long ago, some people thought this was
      due to godlike agents in the sky, and that the sun&#39;s trajectory
      was where Apollo steered his chariot. Today our scientists tell us
      that the sun doesn&#39;t really rise at all,
      because <em>sunrise</em> is simply what we each experience when the
      planet Earth&#39;s rotation moves us into the sun&#39;s unchanging
      light. This means we all <em>know</em> something that isn&#39;t
      true.</p>

    <p>
      To comprehend what knowing is, we have to guard ourselves against
      that single-agent fallacy of thinking that the <em>I</em> in <em>I
	believe</em> is actually a single, stable thing. The truth is that a
      person&#39;s mind holds different views in different realms. Thus,
      one part of an astronomer&#39;s mind can apply the common view of
      sunrise to down-to-earth affairs, regarding the sun as like a lamp
      that wakes us up and lights our way. But at the same time, that same
      astronomer can apply the modern physical view to technical problems
      in astronomy. We each use many different views, and which we choose
      to use depends, from one moment to the next, upon the changing
      balance of power among our agencies.</p>

    <p>
      Then if what we <em>believe</em> is so conditional, what makes us
      feel that our beliefs are much more definite than that? It is
      because whenever we commit ourselves to speak or act, we thereby
      have to force ourselves into clear-cut, action-oriented states of
      mind in which most of our questions are suppressed. As far as
      everyday life is concerned, decisiveness is indispensable; otherwise
      we&#39;d have to act so cautiously that nothing would get done. And
      here lies much of what we express with words
      like <em>guess,</em> <em>believe,</em> and <em>know.</em> In the
      course of making practical decisions (and thereby turning off most
      agencies), we use such words to summarize our various varieties of
      certainty.</p>

    <p>
      The notion that only certain of a person&#39;s beliefs
      are <em>genuine</em> plays vital roles in all our moral and legal
      schemes. Whenever we censure or applaud what other people do,
      we&#39;re taught to be more concerned with what those other
      people <em>genuinely</em> expected or intended to happen than with
      what actually happened. This doctrine underlies how we distinguish
      thoughtlessness and forgetfulness from lies, deceit, and
      treachery. I do not mean that such distinctions are not important,
      only that they do not justify the simplistic assumption that, among
      all the mind&#39;s activities, certain special kinds of thoughts are
      essentially more
      <em>genuine</em> than others. All such distinctions seem less
      absolute when every deeper probe into beliefs reveals more
      ambiguities.</p>
