<h2>24.2 frames of mind</h2>

    <p>
      A frame is a sort of skeleton, somewhat like an application form
      with many blanks or slots to be filled. We&#39;ll call these blanks
      its terminals; we use them as connection points to which we can
      attach other kinds of information. For example, a frame that
      represents a
      <em>chair</em> might have some terminals to represent a seat, a
      back, and legs, while a frame to represent a <em>person</em> would
      have some terminals for a body and head and arms and legs. To
      represent a particular chair or person, we simply fill in the
      terminals of the corresponding frame with structures that represent,
      in more detail, particular features of the back, seat, and legs of
      that particular person or chair. As we&#39;ll see, virtually any
      kind of agent can be attached to a frame-terminal. It can be a
      K-line, polyneme, isonome, memory-control script, or, best of all,
      another frame.</p>

    <p>
      In principle, we could use frames without attaching their terminals
      to anything. Normally, though, the terminals come with other agents
      already attached &mdash; and these are what we called <em>default
	assignments</em> when we first talked about level-bands. If one of
      your person-frames is active, and you actually see some arms and
      legs, their descriptions will be assigned to the proper terminals.
      However, if certain parts cannot be seen, perhaps because
      they&#39;re out of view, the missing information will be filled in
      by default. We use default assumptions all the time: that&#39;s how,
      when you see someone wearing shoes, you <em>know</em> that there are
      feet in them.  From where do those assumptions come? I&#39;ll argue
      that</p>

    <p>
      Default assumptions fill our frames to represent what&#39;s typical.</p>

    <p>
      As soon as you hear a word like <em>person,</em> <em>frog,</em>
      or <em>chair,</em> you assume the details of some <em>typical</em>
      sort of person, frog, or chair.  You do this not only with language,
      but with vision, too. For example, when someone is seated across the
      table from you, you may be unable to see any part of that
      person&#39;s chair. Still, this situation will probably activate a
      sitting-frame. But a sitting-frame will surely have a terminal for
      what to sit upon, and that will be assigned, by default, to some
      stereotypical chair. Then, though there is no chair in sight, a
      chair-frame will be supplied by default.  Default assignments are of
      huge significance because they help us represent our previous
      experience. We use them for reasoning, recognizing, generalizing,
      predicting what may happen next, and knowing what we ought to try
      when expectations aren&#39;t met. Our frames affect our every
      thought and everything we do.</p>

    <p>
      Frames are drawn from past experience and rarely fit new situations
      perfectly. We therefore have to learn how to adapt our frames to
      each particular experience. What if a given situation closely
      matches several different frames at once? Some such conflicts could
      be resolved by the <em>locking-in</em> negotiations we described
      earlier; then only the frames that manage to suppress their
      competitors can influence one&#39;s other agencies. But the other
      frames could lurk offstage, awaiting opportunities to intervene.</p>
