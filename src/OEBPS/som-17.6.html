<h2>17.6 prerequisites for growth</h2>

    <p>
      What controls the pace of mental growth? Although some aspects of
      development depend on external circumstances and others seem to
      happen only by chance, certain aspects of our growth seem almost to
      proceed relentlessly from stage to stage, as though those stages
      were predestined. This brings us back to asking why development
      proceeds in stages at all.</p>

    <p>
      One reason a skill may grow in steps is that it
      needs <em>prerequisites.</em>  You cannot start to build a house by
      placing its roof on top; first you have to build some
      walls. That&#39;s not an arbitrary rule; it&#39;s inherent in the
      enterprise. It is the same for mental skills; some processes cannot
      be learned until certain other processes become available. Many of
      Piaget&#39;s theories were based on his suspicion that certain
      concepts had prerequisites. For example, he argued that a child must
      possess ideas about which operations are reversible before that
      child can grow good concepts about how quantities are
      conserved. Hypotheses like these led Piaget to do his great
      experiments. But consider how easily those experiments could have
      been done a thousand years before; the only equipment they required
      were children, water, and various jars.  Were Piaget&#39;s ideas
      prerequisites for conceiving those experiments?</p>

    <p>
      To build a good Society-of-More, it simply would not be practical
      for a child to introduce those middle-level agents Appearance and
      History until some lower-level agents such as Tall, Thin, No Loss,
      and Reversible had become available. Before that stage, there would
      be nothing for those managers to do! To be sure, that isn&#39;t
      strictly true, just as one could start to construct a house with a
      roof, by using temporary scaffolding and later building the
      house&#39;s sides. We can never be absolutely sure of what a
      skill&#39;s prerequisites must be &mdash; and this will always
      complicate psychology.</p>

    <p>
      The reason we know so little about how children&#39;s minds grow is
      that we can&#39;t observe the processes that are responsible. It
      could take several years to refine a new agency, and during that
      time, the child&#39;s behavior will be dominated by other processes
      in other agencies, which are themselves growing through their own,
      overlapping stages of development. A serious problem for the
      psychologist is that certain types of mental growth can never be
      directly observed at all. This applies, in particular, to those
      all-important <em>B-brain</em> processes with which we learn new
      ways to learn. Only the indirect products of this ever appear in the
      child&#39;s actual behavior, and even these may not become overt
      until long after that higher-level growth has occurred.  Perhaps
      most difficult of all is detecting the development of suppressors
      and censors. See 27.2. It is hard enough to analyze what people do,
      but it is almost impossible to recognize the things they never do.</p>

    <p>
      To make matters worse, many of the <em>stages of development</em>
      that we actually observe do not really exist. From time to time,
      each parent has the illusion that a child has suddenly changed, when
      this is only the result of not observing several smaller, real
      changes in the past. In such a case, if there exists a <em>stage of
	growth,</em> it is inside the parent&#39;s mind, and not in the
      child at all!</p>
