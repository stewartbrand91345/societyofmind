<h2>30.3 mental models</h2>

    <p>
      Does a book know what is written inside it? Clearly, no. Does a book
      contain knowledge? Clearly, yes. But how could anything contain
      knowledge, yet not know it? We&#39;ve seen how saying that a person
      or machine possesses knowledge amounts to saying that some observer
      could employ that person or machine to answer certain kinds of
      questions. Here is another view of what it means to know.</p>

    <p>
      <em>Jack knows about A</em> means that there is a <em>model</em> M
      of A inside Jack&#39;s head.</p>

    <p>
      But what does it mean to say that one thing is a model of another
      and how could one have a model in one&#39;s head? Again, we have to
      specify some standard or authority. Let&#39;s make Jack be the judge
      of that:</p>

    <p>
      Jack considers M to be a good model of A to the extent that he finds
      M useful for answering questions about A.</p>

    <p>
      For example, suppose that A is a real automobile, and M is the kind
      of object we call a <em>toy</em> or <em>model</em> car. Then Jack
      will be able to use M to answer certain questions about A. However,
      we would think it strange to say that M is
      Jack&#39;s <em>knowledge</em> about A &mdash; because we reserve the
      word <em>knowledge</em> for something inside a head, and Jack
      can&#39;t keep a toy inside his head. But we never said that a model
      must be an ordinary physical object. Our definition allows a model
      to be anything that helps a person answer questions. Accordingly, a
      person could possess a
      <em>mental model,</em> too &mdash; in the form of some machinery or
      subsociety of agents inside the brain. This provides us with a
      simple explanation of what we mean by knowledge: Jack&#39;s
      knowledge about A is simply whichever mental models, processes, or
      agencies Jack&#39;s other agencies can use to answer questions about
      A. Thus, a person&#39;s mental model of a car need not itself
      resemble an actual car in any obvious way. It need not itself be
      heavy, fast, or consume gasoline to be able to answer questions
      about a car like <em>How heavy is it?</em> or <em>How fast can it
	go?</em></p>

    <p>
      Our mental models also work in social realms to answer questions
      like <em>Who owns that car?</em> or <em>Who permitted you to park it
	there?</em>  However, to understand questions like these, we have to
      ask what people mean by <em>who</em> &mdash; and the answer is that
      we make mental models of people, too. In order for Mary
      to <em>know</em> about Jack&#39;s dispositions, motives, and
      possessions, Mary has to build inside her head some structure to
      help answer those kinds of questions &mdash; and that structure will
      constitute her mental model of Jack. Just think of all the different
      things our person-models do for us! If Mary knows Jack well enough,
      she&#39;ll be able to reply not only to physical questions like
      <em>How tall is Jack?</em> but also to social inquiries such
      as <em>Does he like me?</em> and even to psychological queries
      like <em>What are Jack&#39;s ideals?</em>  Quite possibly,
      Mary&#39;s model of Jack will be able to produce more accurate
      answers to such questions than Jack himself could produce.
      People&#39;s mental models of their friends are often better, in
      certain respects, than their mental models of themselves.</p>

    <p>
      We all make models of ourselves and use them to predict which sorts
      of things we&#39;ll later be disposed to do. Naturally, our models
      of ourselves will often provide us with wrong answers because they
      are not faultless ways to see ourselves, but merely self-made
      answering machines.</p>
