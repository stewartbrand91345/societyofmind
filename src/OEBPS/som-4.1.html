<h1>4 The Self</h1>
<h2>4.1 the self</h2>

    <blockquote class="dictionary">

    <p>
      We all believe that human minds contain those special entities we call
      selves. But no one agrees about what they are. To keep things straight,
      I shall write <em>self</em> when speaking in a general sense about an
      entire person and reserve <em>Self</em> for talking about that more
      mysterious sense of personal identity. Here are some of the things
      people say about the Self:</p>

    <p>
      Self is the part of mind that&#39;s really me, or rather, it&#39;s the
      part of me &mdash; that is, part of my mind &mdash; that actually does
      the thinking and wanting and deciding and enjoying and</p>

    <p>
      suffering. It&#39;s the part that&#39;s most important to me because
      it&#39;s that which stays the same through all experience &mdash; the
      identity which ties everything together. And whether you can treat it
      scientifically or not, I know it&#39;s there, because it&#39;s
      me. Perhaps it&#39;s the sort of thing that Science can&#39;t explain.</p>

    <p>
      This isn&#39;t much of a definition, but I don&#39;t think it is a good
      idea to try to find a better one. It often does more harm than good to
      force definitions on things we don&#39;t understand. Besides, only in
      logic and mathematics do definitions ever capture concepts
      perfectly. The things we deal with in practical life are usually too
      complicated to be represented by neat, compact expressions. Especially
      when it comes to understanding minds, we still know so little that we
      can&#39;t be sure our ideas about psychology are even aimed in the right
      directions. In any case, one must not mistake defining things for
      knowing what they are. You can know what a tiger is without defining
      it. You may define a tiger, yet know scarcely anything about it.</p>

    <p>
      Even if our old ideas about the mind are wrong, we can learn a lot by
      trying to understand why we believe them. Instead of asking, <em>What
        are Selves?</em> we can ask, instead, <em>What are our ideas about
        Selves?</em> &mdash; and then we can ask, <em>What psychological
        functions do those ideas serve?</em> When we do this, it shows us that
      we do not have one such idea, but many.</p>

    <p>
      Our ideas about our Selves include beliefs about what we are. These
      include beliefs both about what we are capable of doing and about what
      we may be disposed to do. We exploit these beliefs whenever we solve
      problems or make plans. I&#39;ll refer to them, rather vaguely, as a
      person&#39;s self-images. In addition to our self-images, our ideas
      about ourselves also include ideas about what we&#39;d like to be and
      ideas about what we ought to be. These, which I&#39;ll call a
      person&#39;s self-ideals, influence each person&#39;s growth from
      infancy, but we usually find them hard to express because they&#39;re
      inaccessible to consciousness.</p>
