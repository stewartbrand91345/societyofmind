<h2>30.5 knowing ourselves</h2>

    <p>
      Now let&#39;s ask Mary to describe herself &mdash; to tell us
      everything she can about her shape and weight and size and strength,
      her dispositions and her traits, her accomplishments and ambitions,
      wishes, fears, possessions, and so on. What might be the general
      character of what we&#39;d hear? At first it would be hard to
      assemble any coherent sense of all those details. But gradually
      we&#39;d notice that various groups of items were closely related,
      while others were rarely mentioned in connection with one
      another. Little by little, we would discern structure and
      organization in what Mary had said, and finally we&#39;d start to
      see the outlines of at least two different mental realms.</p>

    <p>
      Now, what would happen if we asked Mary to speak not about specific
      things, but about the general subject of <em>What kind of entity am
	I?</em> Since she has no direct way to examine her entire self, she
      can only summarize what she can discover about her mental model of
      herself. In doing so, she&#39;ll probably find that almost
      everything she knows appears to lie in two domains, with relatively
      little in between.  This means that Mary&#39;s model of her model of
      herself will have an overall dumbbell shape, one side of which
      represents her physical self, the other side of which represents her
      psychological self.</p>

    <p>
      Do people go on to make models of their models of their models of
      themselves? If we kept on doing things like that, we&#39;d get
      trapped in an infinite regress. What saves us is that we get
      confused and lose track of the distinctions between each model and
      the next &mdash; just as our language-agencies lose track when they
      hear about <em>the rat that the cat that the dog worried
	killed.</em> The same thing must happen whenever we ask ourselves
      questions like <em>Did John know that I knew that he knew that I
	knew that he knew that?</em> And the same thing happens whenever we
      try to probe into our own motivations by continually
      repeating, <em>What was my motive for wanting that?</em></p>

    <p>
      Eventually, we simply stop and say, <em>Because I simply wanted
	to.</em>  The same when we find things hard to decide: we can simply
      say, <em>I just decide,</em> and this can help us interrupt what
      otherwise might be an endless chain of reasoning.</p>
