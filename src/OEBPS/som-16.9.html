<h2>16.9 infant emotions</h2>

 <blockquote style="text-align:left;">
<br/>
A child forsaken, waking suddenly,<br/>
Whose gaze afeard on all things round doth rove<br/>   
And seeth only that it cannot see<br/>
The meeting eyes of love<br/>

    <p>
      Some readers may be horrified at picturing a baby&#39;s mind as made
      up of nearly separate agencies. But we&#39;ll never understand how
      human natures grow without some theories for how they start. One
      evidence for separateness is how suddenly infants switch from smiles
      of contentment to shrieks of hunger-rage. In contrast to the complex
      mixtures of expressions that adults show, young children seem
      usually to be in one or another well-defined state of activity
      &mdash; contentment, hunger, sleepiness, play, affection, or
      whatever. Older children show less sudden mood changes, and their
      expressions suggest that more different things are happening at
      once. Our minds may thus originate as sets of relatively simple,
      separate need machines. But soon enough each becomes enmeshed in all
      the rest of our growing machinery.</p>

    <p>
      How should we interpret an infant&#39;s apparent single-mindedness?
      One explanation of those striking shifts in attitude is that one
      agency attains control and forcibly suppresses the rest. Another
      view is that many processes continue at once &mdash; but only one at
      a time can be expressed. It would be more efficient to keep the
      whole array of proto-specialists at work. Then each would be more
      ready to assume control in case of an emergency.</p>

    <p>
      What would be the advantage in a mechanism that makes a baby conceal
      that mixture of emotions, expressing only one of them at a time?
      Perhaps that artificial sharpening promotes the child&#39;s welfare
      by making it easier for the parent to respond to whichever problem
      has the greatest urgency. It&#39;s hard enough to know what infants
      want, yet think how much harder it would be if they confronted us
      with complicated expressions of mixed feelings! Those infants&#39;
      very lives &mdash; and, in turn, our own lives &mdash; depend upon
      their expressing themselves clearly. To achieve that clarity, their
      agencies must be equipped with powerful cross-exclusion devices to
      magnify small differences that make it clear which needs come
      first. This leads to simple <em>summaries</em> &mdash; which
      manifest themselves as drastic changes in appearance, voice, and
      mood that others can interpret easily. And this is why, under
      circumstances in which adults merely frown, babies tend to shriek.</p>

    <p>
      Given that those signs are clear, what forces us to respond to them?
      To help their offspring grow, most animals evolve two matching
      schemes: communication is a two-way street. On one side, babies are
      equipped with cries that can arouse parents far away, out of sight,
      or sound asleep &mdash; for along with sharpening those signs,
      cross-exclusion also amplifies their intensity. And on the other
      side, adults are made to find those signals irresistible: there must
      be special systems in our brains that give such messages a high
      priority. To what might those baby-watching agents be connected? My
      guess is that they&#39;re wired to the remnants of the same
      proto-specialists that, when aroused, caused us as infants to cry in
      the first place. This leads adults to respond to babies&#39; cries
      by attributing to them the same degrees of urgency that we ourselves
      would have to feel to make us shriek with similar intensity. This
      drives the babies&#39; caretakers to respond to their needs with
      urgent sympathy.</p>
